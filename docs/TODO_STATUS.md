# LoRA Easy Training - TODO Status
*Last updated: 2025-07-25*

## 🎉 **Completed Today (Major UI Overhaul)**
- ✅ **Started widget interface reorganization** - Streamlined from 7 accordions to 4 logical sections
- ✅ **Unified Training Configuration section** - Merged Basic Settings + Learning Rate + Training Options
- ✅ **Converted all sliders to text inputs** - MinSNR, Warmup, LoRA structure (Network Dim/Alpha, Conv Dim/Alpha)
- ✅ **Moved commonly used options to basic settings** - Keep tokens, noise offset, clip skip now in main section
- ✅ **Merged advanced sections** - Advanced Training Options + Advanced Mode now single accordion
- ✅ **Theme-compatible styling** - Removed all background colors, border-only design works with any Jupyter theme
- ✅ **Removed biased messaging** - No more judgmental language about dataset sizes or training parameters
- ✅ **Auto-detecting dataset size** - Automatically counts images when dataset directory is selected
- ✅ **Neutral step calculation** - Clean math display without "good/bad" judgments
- ✅ **Added bulk image upload widget** - Users can create folders and upload images directly
- ✅ **Standalone Training Progress Monitor** - Accordion widget with integrated start button, no scary CLI code
- ✅ **Better notebook organization** - Logical flow: Setup → Configure → Start/Monitor → Utilities → Tips

## 🚧 **Still Pending (High Priority)**
- ⏳ **Untangle the uploaders** - Fix confusing upload widget logic and organization
- ⏳ **Fix custom optimizer imports** - LoraEasyCustomOptimizer module not found, setup script needs environment prerequisite checking
- ⏳ **Environment prerequisite validation** - Setup script should verify SD scripts requirements compatibility and install missing custom optimizers
- ⏳ **Update training manager for different model types** - Need FLUX/SD3/SDXL/SD1.5 script selection
- ⏳ **Add model type detection** - Auto-detect from model path/name
- ⏳ **Update network module selection** - Different LoRA modules for different model architectures
- ✅ **Audit ALL selector logic** - Check every dropdown/checkbox actually works (V-pred & DoRA were broken!)
- ✅ **Complete widget logic** - Fixed with ConfigManager file hunting approach, training should now work!

## 🔧 **Code Quality Issues (Low Priority)**
- 📝 **Optimize image counting in core/image_utils.py** - Currently does both recursive AND non-recursive search which is redundant (but works correctly due to set() deduplication)
- 📝 **Consolidate duplicate image counting logic** - Training manager has fallback counting that duplicates widget logic
- 📝 **Standardize import paths** - Some inconsistency between personal_lora_calculator vs core.image_utils imports

## 🎛️ **Widget Logic Audit Results**
### **Duplicated Information Issues:**
- ❌ **Keep Tokens** - Appears in both "Training Configuration" and "Advanced Training Options" sections
- ❌ **Noise Offset** - Duplicated between main training config and advanced options  
- ❌ **Clip Skip** - Shows up in both main section and advanced section
- ❌ **Dataset Directory** - Entered 4 times across tagging/cleanup/caption sections

### **Improper "ADVANCED" Categorization:**
- 🔄 **Miscategorized as Advanced:** Caption Dropout, Tag Dropout, VAE Batch Size, Bucket Resolution Steps (all common settings)
- 🔄 **Should be Advanced:** IP Noise Gamma (FLUX-only), Multi-noise (experimental), Adaptive Noise Scale (research-grade)
- 📝 **IP Noise Gamma Note:** This feature is ONLY for FLUX models and should be model-specific

### **Organizational Issues:**
- 🔄 **Inconsistent Section Logic:** Caching options scattered, scheduler settings mixed between basic/advanced
- 🔄 **Conv Dim/Alpha:** Explanation in LoRA Structure but used across multiple LoRA types

## 🎯 **Critical Fixes Already Completed (Previous Session)**

### **V-Parameterization Bug (CRITICAL)**
- **Issue**: Checkbox wasn't actually enabling v-pred support
- **Result**: LoRAs trained on v-pred models (NoobAI-XL) looked "overbaked"
- **Fix**: Now properly adds `v_parameterization: true` only when checked
- **Impact**: This was probably the main issue with the "overbaked" LoRA!

### **LoRA Type Selection Bug (CRITICAL)**
- **Issue**: DoRA, LoHa, IA3, GLoRA dropdown selections were ignored
- **Result**: Always trained standard LoRA regardless of selection
- **Fix**: Added proper handling for all LyCORIS algorithm types
- **Impact**: User selected DoRA but got regular LoRA instead!

## 🎨 **UI/UX Improvements Completed**

### **Widget Interface Overhaul**
- **Before**: 7 confusing accordion sections with duplicated options
- **After**: 4 logical sections with clean organization
- **Benefit**: Much easier to navigate, no more hunting for options

### **Training Monitor Revolution**
- **Before**: Progress appeared inline with config, scary CLI code visible
- **After**: Dedicated accordion widget with start button, user-friendly interface
- **Benefit**: Clean separation of concerns, less intimidating for users

### **Dataset Management Enhancement**
- **Before**: Only URL-based uploads, manual path entry
- **After**: Bulk image upload, folder creation, auto-detection
- **Benefit**: Perfect for quick prototyping and manual dataset curation

### **Theme Compatibility**
- **Before**: Hard-coded background colors that clashed with dark themes
- **After**: Border-only styling that adapts to any Jupyter theme
- **Benefit**: Works perfectly in light mode, dark mode, or custom themes

## 🔧 **Environment & Backend (Already Stable)**
