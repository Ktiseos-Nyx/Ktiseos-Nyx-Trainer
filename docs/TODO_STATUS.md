# LoRA Easy Training - TODO Status
*Last updated: 2025-07-24*

## üéâ **Completed Today**
- ‚úÖ **Investigate IP Noise Gamma compatibility** - Works across all model types
- ‚úÖ **Add missing SD scripts arguments** - Added caption dropout, noise settings, VAE options, bucketing controls
- ‚úÖ **Fix triton.ops import error** - Added graceful fallbacks for bitsandbytes/triton compatibility issues
- ‚úÖ **Improve environment setup** - Enhanced custom optimizer installation with better diagnostics
- ‚úÖ **Create optimizer compatibility strategy** - Added container detection and warnings for 8bit optimizers
- ‚úÖ **Create dedicated training monitor widget** - Separate widget with phase tracking, progress bars, live updates
- ‚úÖ **Add dataset cleanup feature** - Includes non-image files (.safetensors, .ckpt, configs, etc.)
- ‚úÖ **Fix V-parameterization checkbox bug** - Was not properly enabling v-pred support (major fix!)
- ‚úÖ **Fix LoRA Type selection bug** - DoRA/LoHa/IA3/GLoRA weren't actually being used (CRITICAL!)

## üöß **Still Pending (High Priority)**
- ‚è≥ **Update training manager for different model types** - Need FLUX/SD3/SDXL/SD1.5 script selection
- ‚è≥ **Add model type detection** - Auto-detect from model path/name
- ‚è≥ **Update network module selection** - Different LoRA modules for different model architectures
- ‚è≥ **Audit ALL selector logic** - Check every dropdown/checkbox actually works (V-pred & DoRA were broken!)

## üéØ **Key Fixes Made Tonight**

### **V-Parameterization Bug (CRITICAL)**
- **Issue**: Checkbox wasn't actually enabling v-pred support
- **Result**: LoRAs trained on v-pred models (NoobAI-XL) looked "overbaked" 
- **Fix**: Now properly adds `v_parameterization: true` only when checked
- **Impact**: This was probably the main issue with the "overbaked" LoRA!

### **LoRA Type Selection Bug (CRITICAL)**
- **Issue**: DoRA, LoHa, IA3, GLoRA dropdown selections were ignored
- **Result**: Always trained standard LoRA regardless of selection
- **Fix**: Added proper handling for all LyCORIS algorithm types
- **Impact**: User selected DoRA but got regular LoRA instead!

### **Training Monitor Widget**
- **New Feature**: Separate widget appears during training
- **Shows**: Training phases, epoch/step progress, resource monitoring
- **Clean**: No clutter in config widget, focused monitoring experience

### **Dataset Cleanup**
- **New Feature**: Clean old caption files, cached latents, non-image files
- **Safe**: Preview mode by default, smart file type detection
- **Practical**: Perfect for re-tagging workflows

### **SD Scripts Arguments**
- **Enhanced**: Added caption dropout, tag dropout, noise offset, adaptive noise scale
- **Comprehensive**: VAE batch size, bucketing controls, clip skip
- **Educational**: Tooltips explaining what each option does

## üîß **Environment Improvements**
- **ONNX Support**: Auto-detects and falls back gracefully if missing
- **Better Error Messages**: Specific troubleshooting for different error types
- **Container Detection**: Smart recommendations for VastAI/RunPod users

## üìù **Notes for Next Session**
1. **V-pred + DoRA fixes should solve the "overbaked" LoRA issue** - It was fighting TWO bugs!
2. **Training pipeline is solid** - environment setup, monitoring, all working
3. **URGENT**: Audit ALL selector logic - if V-pred and DoRA were broken, what else is?
4. **Main remaining work**: Model type detection and script selection for FLUX/SD3
5. **Step calculator updated** - now shows realistic 500-5000+ step recommendations
6. **System is production-ready** for SDXL/IllustriousXL training (once selectors are verified)

## üé® **User Feedback Incorporated**
- Step calculator was too conservative (fixed: now 500-5000+ is "good")
- Added container-specific optimizer recommendations
- Training monitor separated from config (cleaner UX)
- Dataset cleanup for re-tagging workflows
- V-pred checkbox actually works now!
