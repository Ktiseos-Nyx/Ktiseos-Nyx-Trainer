# Set the default behavior for all text files.
# 'text=auto' lets Git handle line endings automatically. On checkout,
# it will convert LF to CRLF on Windows. On commit, it will convert
# CRLF back to LF. This is the key to cross-platform harmony.
* text=auto

# These files are text and should be handled by the 'text=auto' rule above.
# We don't need to specify eol=lf for them anymore.
