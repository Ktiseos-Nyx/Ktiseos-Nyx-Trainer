# Beta Planning Document

**Current Version:** Alpha (v0.1.0-dev)
**Target:** Beta Release
**Last Updated:** 2026-05-30

---

## Overview

This document tracks planned features, known issues, and upgrade priorities for the Alpha-to-Beta transition. Beta focus is **UI improvements + feature upgrades**.

---

## 1. Tag/Caption System Upgrades

### 1.1 Tag Viewer with Frequency Counts (NEW FEATURE)
**Priority:** High
**Inspiration:** Civitai `TrainingImagesTagViewer` (Apache 2.0)
**Status:** ✅ Done (2026-05-25) — tags/page.tsx frequency chips with counts (confirmed in UI)

Add a Tag Viewer panel to the dataset page that:
- Aggregates all tags across all images in a dataset
- Displays each unique tag with its occurrence count, sorted by frequency
- Supports search/filter within the tag list
- Allows multi-select of tags (for bulk operations)
- Shows a "None" sentinel for untagged images
- Shows image count and selected tag count badges

**Implementation notes:**
- Core logic: `flatMap` all caption .txt files -> count occurrences with reduce -> sort by frequency
- Frontend component with selectable chips/badges
- Requires a new API endpoint: `GET /api/dataset/{name}/tag-summary` that reads all .txt files and returns `{ tag: string, count: number }[]`

**Files to create/modify:**
- `frontend/app/dataset/[name]/` - new tag viewer component
- `api/routes/dataset.py` - new endpoint
- `services/tagging_service.py` - aggregation logic

### 1.2 Bulk Tag Operations (NEW FEATURE)
**Priority:** High
**Inspiration:** Civitai `TrainingEditTagsModal` + `TrainingImagesTagViewer` actions menu (Apache 2.0)
**Status:** ✅ Done (2026-05-25) — bulk remove/replace in tags/page.tsx Actions menu

Once the Tag Viewer exists, add bulk actions on selected tags:
- **Remove tags** - delete selected tags from ALL images in dataset (with confirmation)
- **Replace tags** - find-and-replace: show each selected tag with input for replacement, apply across all images

**Implementation notes:**
- Civitai's replace modal is ~85 lines, very clean pattern
- Needs API endpoints: `POST /api/dataset/{name}/tags/remove` and `POST /api/dataset/{name}/tags/replace`
- Should operate on .txt files on disk, not just in-memory

### 1.3 Upgrade Overwrite Mode from Bool to 3-Way
**Priority:** Medium
**Status:** ✅ Done (2026-05-25) — auto-tag/page.tsx `overwriteMode` Select (ignore/append/overwrite)

Current: `append_tags: bool` (append or overwrite)
Target: `overwrite_mode: "ignore" | "append" | "overwrite"`

- **ignore** = skip files that already have labels
- **append** = add new tags to end of existing labels
- **overwrite** = replace existing labels entirely

**Files to modify:**
- `services/models/tagging.py` - change `append_tags: bool` to `overwrite_mode: Literal["ignore", "append", "overwrite"]`
- `frontend/app/dataset/[name]/auto-tag/page.tsx` - replace checkbox with segmented control
- `services/tagging_service.py` - handle new mode in tag processing
- `custom/tag_images_by_wd14_tagger.py` - update CLI args

### 1.4 Per-Image Visual Tag Editor
**Priority:** Low (Beta+)
**Status:** ✅ Done (2026-05-25) — per-image inline tag editor (badge chips + add) in tags/page.tsx

Visual tag editing per image: show tags as badge chips with X to remove, textarea to add new tags. Would require the frontend to read/write individual .txt caption files via API.

### 1.5 Delete Image from Tag Editor (NEW FEATURE)
**Priority:** Medium (Beta QOL)

Let users delete an image directly from the tag editor (remove a mistakenly-added pic). Three pieces:
- New `/api/dataset/delete-image` route — takes dataset + image name, uses the existing `validateDatasetPath` guard, deletes the image **and its sibling `.txt` caption**.
- `datasetAPI.deleteImage(...)` client method.
- Per-image delete button in the editor behind an AlertDialog confirm (the Models-page pattern, never native `confirm()`), then drop the image from state.

Estimate: ~1–2 hrs, low-to-moderate — path-safety helper and the `name.txt` caption convention already exist, so the risky parts are easy.

### 1.6 Breadcrumbs on Tag Editor / Dataset Sub-Pages
**Priority:** Low (Beta QOL)

The dataset sub-pages (`/dataset/[name]/tags`, `/auto-tag`, `/tag-processing`) lack a breadcrumb trail (e.g. Home › Dataset › [name] › Tags). Bigger than it looks: requires threading the dataset name + current sub-page context through these routes rather than a single static breadcrumb.

### 1.7 Auto-Tagger Page Redesign — Match LoRA-Card Structure
**Priority:** Medium (UX — long-intended, never executed)
**Status:** ⏳ Not started

The **auto-tagger** page (`frontend/app/dataset/[name]/auto-tag/page.tsx`) — the batch WD14/BLIP/GIT tagging interface — was always meant to be fleshed back out to mirror the **LoRA/training card structure** (the shadcn `Card`-based layout in `frontend/components/training/cards/*.tsx`), but never got it. This is the **auto-tagger**, NOT the tag editor (`tags/page.tsx`, §1.1–1.6, done).

**Approach — rip-and-replace, not iterate.** If reformatting the existing page into the card structure is awkward, **don't** — delete it and build a fresh card-based page. The prior "that's too much work to format over time" read was wrong: the cost lives in *iterating on a bad base*, not in a clean rebuild. Greenfield it.

**Target:** same `Card` / `CardHeader` / `CardContent` componentry and visual rhythm as the training cards, so the auto-tagger reads as part of the same app instead of an older flat form.

## 2. Checkpoint Training - Audit Results

### 2.1 Current State
Checkpoint training (full fine-tune) IS implemented in the backend:
- `TrainingMode.CHECKPOINT` exists in `services/models/training.py:142`
- Script selection works in `services/trainers/kohya.py:289-303`:
  - SD1.5 -> `fine_tune.py`
  - SDXL -> `sdxl_train.py`
  - Flux -> `flux_train.py`
  - SD3 -> `sd3_train.py`
  - Lumina -> `lumina_train.py`
  - Chroma -> `flux_train.py` (with --model_type chroma)
  - Anima -> `anima_train.py`
  - HunyuanImage -> LoRA only (correctly blocked)
- TOML generation correctly skips network args for checkpoint mode (`kohya_toml.py:183-184`)
- Validation catches high network_dim for non-checkpoint mode (`training.py:81`)

### 2.2 Known Issues - Checkpoint Training

**Issue CT-1: No checkpoint-specific validation** — 🚫 **WON'T DO (2026-06-10)**
- **Severity:** Medium → **Rejected**
- **Location:** `api/routes/training.py:33-253`
- **Problem:** Proposed VRAM warnings and LR range checks for checkpoint mode
- **Rationale:** This is conventional-wisdom nannying — exactly the bias pattern rejected in **LT-7** (removed DatasetCard VRAM warning) and **LT-5** (rejected algorithm-specific LR hints). Users on 48GB cards know their VRAM; LR ranges are empirical, not rules. "Warning" = quiet should = bias by suggestion.
- **Non-biased validation that DOES belong:** structural/hard errors only (missing required files, invalid enums, path traversal, negative/zero where structurally impossible). Everything else → docs/wiki.

**Issue CT-2: No UI indication of checkpoint mode limitations**
- **Severity:** Low
- **Location:** Frontend training config page
- **Problem:** Users can select checkpoint mode but may not understand VRAM requirements or that LoRA-specific fields (network_dim, network_alpha, etc.) are irrelevant in this mode
- **Fix:** Conditionally hide/disable LoRA fields when checkpoint mode selected, show VRAM warnings

**Issue CT-3: Lumina checkpoint training script may not exist**
- **Severity:** Needs verification
- **Location:** `services/trainers/kohya.py:297`
- **Problem:** Maps to `lumina_train.py` but needs verification that this script exists in sd_scripts
- **Fix:** Verify script existence, add runtime check

**Issue CT-4: Anima missing from checkpoint script map**
- **Status:** ✅ **Done — verified in code 2026-06-06.** `kohya.py:301` now maps `ModelType.ANIMA: "anima_train.py"` in the CHECKPOINT `script_map`. No longer falls back to `fine_tune.py`.
- **Severity:** High (bug)
- **Location:** `services/trainers/kohya.py:299`
- **Problem:** `script_map` for CHECKPOINT mode doesn't include Anima. It falls back to `fine_tune.py` (SD1.5 script) which is the wrong script. `anima_train.py` exists but isn't mapped.
- **Fix:** Add `ModelType.ANIMA: "anima_train.py"` to the checkpoint script_map

**Issue CT-5: CheckpointTrainingConfig frontend type incomplete**
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Location:** `frontend/components/checkpoint/CheckpointTrainingConfig.tsx:19`
- **Problem:** Type only includes `SD15 | SDXL | FLUX | SD3 | LUMINA` - missing SD3.5, Chroma, Anima
- **Fix:** Update TypeScript type to match backend ModelType enum

**Issue CT-6: Redundant TOML generation**
- **Severity:** Low (tech debt)
- **Location:** `services/trainers/kohya.py:51-78`
- **Problem:** TOML files generated in `trainer/runtime_store/` then copied to `config/`. Should generate once in final location.
- **Fix:** Generate directly to final destination

**Issue CT-7: WebSocket routes exist but are unused**
- **Severity:** Low (dead code)
- **Location:** `services/websocket.py:19-100`
- **Problem:** WebSocket endpoints defined but frontend uses HTTP polling due to VastAI Caddy proxy incompatibility. Code is never called.
- **Fix:** Document the reason or conditionally disable

**Issue CT-8: TODO comment references incomplete Node.js migration**
- **Severity:** Low (architectural clarity)
- **Location:** `frontend/lib/api.ts:794`
- **Problem:** Comment says "Node.js route exists at /jobs/training" and "TODO: Unify this in a future update" - indicates incomplete migration
- **Fix:** Decide on architecture direction and clean up or complete migration

---

## 3. Merging Tool - Audit Results

### 3.1 Current State
Both LoRA and Checkpoint merging are implemented:
- **LoRA merge:** `POST /api/utilities/lora/merge` - supports SD, SDXL, Flux, SVD
- **Checkpoint merge:** `POST /api/utilities/checkpoint/merge` - weighted merge with UNet-only option
- **LoRA resize:** `POST /api/utilities/lora/resize` - SVD-based rank reduction
- Frontend has a 3-tab UI (Merge LoRAs, Merge Checkpoints, Resize LoRA)

### 3.2 Known Issues - Merging Tool

**Issue MG-1: Alpha parameter silently ignored in LoRA resize**
- **Severity:** High (UX deception)
- **Location:** `services/lora_service.py:98-101`
- **Problem:** Frontend allows setting `newAlpha` but `resize_lora.py` doesn't support `--new_alpha`. Alpha is auto-calculated from SVD rank. User thinks they're controlling alpha but it's ignored.
- **Fix:** Either remove alpha input from frontend with explanation, or show it as read-only "will be auto-calculated"

**Issue MG-2: Parameter naming inconsistency**
- **Severity:** Medium (confusion)
- **Location:** `services/lora_service.py:298` vs `services/lora_service.py:400`
- **Problem:** LoRA merge uses `--save_precision` but checkpoint merge uses `--saving_precision` (different Kohya scripts expect different arg names). This is correct behavior but confusing in the codebase.
- **Fix:** Add comments explaining the naming difference is intentional per-script

**Issue MG-3: No subprocess timeout**
- **Severity:** Medium (reliability)
- **Location:** `services/lora_service.py:320-327, 428-435`
- **Problem:** `await process.communicate()` has no timeout. A hung merge process blocks the worker indefinitely.
- **Fix:** Use `asyncio.wait_for(process.communicate(), timeout=3600)` with proper cleanup

**Issue MG-4: No CUDA availability check**
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Location:** `services/lora_service.py:312, 420`
- **Problem:** If user requests `device: "cuda"` but no GPU is available, the merge script will fail with an unhelpful error.
- **Fix:** Check `torch.cuda.is_available()` before passing cuda device, return clear error

**Issue MG-5: SD3 merge not exposed**
- **Severity:** Low (missing feature)
- **Location:** `trainer/derrian_backend/sd_scripts/tools/merge_sd3_safetensors.py` exists but isn't wired up
- **Problem:** SD3 users can't merge models via the web UI
- **Fix:** Add SD3 merge option to the API and frontend

**Issue MG-6: Stdout not logged during merges**
- **Severity:** Low (observability)
- **Location:** `services/lora_service.py:320-327`
- **Problem:** Subprocess stdout is captured but never logged or surfaced
- **Fix:** Log at debug level, optionally stream to frontend for progress

**Issue MG-7: No merge progress reporting**
- **Severity:** Low (UX)
- **Problem:** Large checkpoint merges (2-7GB each) can take minutes with no progress indicator beyond a spinner
- **Fix:** Parse stdout for progress info, send via job status polling

**Issue MG-8: Missing output file existence check**
- **Severity:** Low
- **Location:** `services/lora_service.py:334`
- **Problem:** Reads file size without verifying output file actually exists
- **Fix:** Add `output_path.exists()` check before stat()

**Issue MG-9: LoRA → Checkpoint merging (bake LoRA into base model)** *(feature request — 2026-05-28)* — **FIRST SLICE when picked up**
- **Severity:** Feature request (backlog)
- **Problem:** No path to bake a LoRA's weights directly into a base checkpoint and save a standalone merged model. Current "LoRA merge" combines LoRAs; "Checkpoint merge" is a checkpoint↔checkpoint weighted merge.
- **Backend status (verified in source 2026-05-30, NOT yet run):** the capability already exists. `networks/merge_lora.py` and `networks/sdxl_merge_lora.py` have `merge_to_sd_model()` which applies a LoRA onto the base model and saves a full checkpoint. This is an *expose-existing-capability* job, not a new feature.
- **Fix:** Add a "merge LoRA into checkpoint" mode (LoRA + base ckpt → merged ckpt) in the API + UI. Wire `merge_to_sd_model` path. See §3.3 for the agreed shape.
- **Status:** 🔧 **Built 2026-06-16 — wired, NOT yet run.** Full stack: `LoRAToCheckpointRequest/Response` (`services/models/lora.py`), `lora_service.merge_lora_to_checkpoint()` (clones `merge_lora()` + passes `--sd_model` → `merge_to_sd_model()` saves a full checkpoint; SD1.5 + SDXL only), route `POST /utilities/lora/merge-to-checkpoint` (`api/routes/utilities.py`), `utilitiesAPI.mergeLoraToCheckpoint()` (`api.ts`), and a new **"LoRA → Checkpoint"** tab (base-ckpt picker + LoRA multi-select w/ ratios + sd/sdxl toggle, sourced from trainer + ComfyUI dirs). py_compile/tsc/eslint clean. **Needs a real GPU run to verify the bake produces a valid checkpoint** (Dusk's test). MBW/`--lbws` (MG-10) still deferred.

**Issue MG-10: Block-weight (LBW-style) control for LoRA merge** *(feature request — 2026-05-28)*
- **Severity:** Feature request (backlog)
- **Problem:** No per-block (layer block weight) control when merging LoRAs — only a single global model/clip strength. Block weighting tunes individual UNet blocks (IN/MID/OUT) for finer style vs. likeness control.
- **Backend status (verified in source 2026-05-30, NOT yet run):** the LBW engine already exists. `networks/sdxl_merge_lora.py` accepts `--lbws`; `networks/svd_merge_lora.py` holds the machinery — `format_lbws`, `get_lbw_block_index`, and presets at **12/17/20/26 blocks** (`ACCEPTABLE = [12, 17, 20, 26]`; 26 = full `BASE/IN00-11/M00/OUT00-11` SuperMerger MBW layout). The frontend currently sends only a global strength and discards this. SD1.5 path (`merge_lora.py`) lacks `--lbws` — route SD1.5 block merges through the SVD path.
- **Fix:** Expose `--lbws` in the merge flow, **presets first** (see §3.3).
- **Status:** 🔧 **Built 2026-06-16 — wired, NOT yet run (SDXL).** Presets-first per §3.3. `presets/block_weights.json` = SD1.5 set **lifted verbatim from SuperMerger `mbwpresets_master.txt`** (38 presets, 26-len) + curated **SDXL set (11 presets, 20-len)** position curves (FLAT/GRAD/COSINE/IN/MID/OUT/ALL). `block_weights` field on `LoRAMergeRequest`+`LoRAToCheckpointRequest` → `--lbws` (one JSON array per LoRA) via `_block_weight_args()`; `GET /utilities/block-weight-presets` serves them. Frontend `BlockWeightPicker` (SDXL-only dropdown, default "None/uniform") on Merge-LoRAs + LoRA→Checkpoint tabs. **Key constraint found:** backend infers arch from length — **SDXL = 12/20, SD1.5 = 17/26** (`SDXL_LAYER_NUM=[12,20]`); SD1.5 block weights only work on the **SVD LoRA-merge path** (the SD1.5 *bake* script `merge_lora.py` has no `--lbws`), so MVP wires **SDXL only** (merge + bake), SD1.5 deferred. py_compile/tsc/eslint clean. **Needs a real SDXL GPU run to verify the block-weighted bake/merge.**

### 3.3 SuperMerger-lite Vision *(captured 2026-05-30)*

North star: a merge experience inspired by A1111 **SuperMerger** + the batteriesincluded merger, scoped to what a training tool can do safely. Guiding rule from Dusk: **"mix the best of proven tools, borrow presets that already work, never invent untested merge math."** Homegrown merge algorithms silently corrupt models — only wire proven paths.

**Decided scope:**
- ✅ **Presets-first block weights.** Ship named block presets (GRAD_V/FLAT/COSINE-style) as the entry point. Full 26-block manual entry is an opt-in *Advanced* mode added later. Easy first, difficult later. (Dusk personally uses presets; power users will want full manual eventually.)
- ✅ **First slice = MG-9** (bake LoRA → checkpoint). Backend ready.
- ✅ **Then MG-10** block-weight LoRA merge (presets), backend ready via `--lbws`.
- ❌ **Out, permanently:** merge-in-RAM and live gen/test (Dusk finds it confusing; also would need a ComfyUI bridge). Do not build.
- ❌ **XY/grid ratio plots** — out (needs a gen pipeline). Future only, would pair with a ComfyUI bridge.
- ❌ **SD3 (MG-5)** — **perma-deferred** (SD3 **deprecated per Stability AI**; also deprecated on Civitai + licensing uncertainty). No SD3 work unless a user explicitly asks. Don't rip out existing SD3/SD3.5 enum entries — just no new investment.

**Preset/merge-mode references (borrow proven values from these, don't reinvent):**

*Tier 1 — canonical preset sources (lift preset definitions from here):*
- `bbc-mc/sdweb-merge-block-weighted-gui` — **the canonical 25-block MBW GUI.** Provides all the named presets: GRAD_V, GRAD_A, FLAT, WRAP, MID12_50, OUT07/12, RING, SMOOTHSTEP, COSINE, cubic Hermite. `base_alpha` controls TE/VAE separately from UNet. 25 comma-separated values input. **Primary source for preset arrays.**
- `Faildes/Chattiori-Model-Merger` — CLI merger, ships a ready-made **`mbwpresets_master.txt`** (readable preset dictionary). 24+ modes (WS/SIG/GEO/MAX, Add/Smooth-Add/Multiply/Similarity/Train Difference, Triple/Tensor Sum, Sum Twice, DARE, Orthogonalized Delta, Sparse Top-k, cosine structure modes). 19/25-length block weights + elemental syntax. CPU-default, supports Flux. **Architecturally closest to how we call Kohya scripts (CLI/subprocess).**

*Tier 1.5 — Anima-relevant:*
- `kiygskr/sd-webui-supermerger-forgeneo-anima` — SuperMerger fork with **Anima + ForgeNeo support** (relevant to our Anima work). Caveat per its README: changes mostly authored by Codex, correctness unverified — reference only, don't trust blindly.

*Tier 2 — architecture / mode references:*
- `Ktiseos-Nyx/sdwebui-batteriesincluded-merger` — Dusk's own fork. 15 merge modes (Weight-Sum, Triple/Quad Sum, Sum Twice, Add/Multiply/Train Difference, DARE Power-up, Extract, interpolation variants), per-block weights, regex layer filtering, YAML weight editor.
- `silveroxides/sd-webui-untitledmerger` — fork of groinge's merger; roadmap includes "block weights reformatted for SuperMerger preset compatibility." Calc reuse for fast merges. References sd-webui-supermerger, safetensors-merge-supermario, MergeLM.
- `wkpark/sd-webui-model-mixer` — modern; sequential merge of up to 5 models, block-level rebasin, LoRA/LyCORIS↔checkpoint, no mandatory save. Good architecture model.
- `ddPn08/maji-merger` — JSON per-key alpha + longest-key-match targeting. Pattern reference for a future Advanced/elemental mode (early repo, ~2 commits).

*Parked — out of agreed scope (need a generation/scoring pipeline; revisit only with a ComfyUI bridge):*
- `s1dlx/sd-webui-bayesian-merger` — auto-tunes the 26 block params + base_alpha by generating & scoring images (Bayesian optimization). Same category as the cut live-gen/XY features. Future-only.
- `ashen-sensored/stable-diffusion-webui-vae-merger` — VAE-only merging (up to 3 VAEs, per-key alpha). Self-described experimental. Possible niche side-feature someday, not core.

- ⚠️ Several references are **AGPL-3.0** — reimplementing preset *values*/arrays is fine; copying source needs license care. (`bbc-mc`'s preset arrays and Chattiori's `mbwpresets_master.txt` are the safest lifts as data, not code.)
- *(A third repo — a fork of Dusk's batteriesincluded-merger with extra presets — was sought but not located.)*

**Note:** none of the §3.2 backend findings have been *run* — all "backend ready" claims are verified-in-source only. First implementation step is a manual smoke test of `merge_to_sd_model` and `--lbws` before building UI on top.

> **Note (2026-05-28):** the merge-tool fixes in commit `80144fd` (paths, `size_formatted`, dirs) are **not yet verified** — needs a fetch-restart + manual run before MG items are re-audited as done.

## 4. LoRA Training - Audit Results

### 4.1 Current State
LoRA training pipeline is solid (~99% functional). Audit performed on:
- API routes (`api/routes/training.py`)
- Training service (`services/training_service.py`)
- Kohya trainer (`services/trainers/kohya.py`)
- TOML generator (`services/trainers/kohya_toml.py`)
- Training config model (`services/models/training.py`)
- Job manager (`services/jobs/job_manager.py`)
- Frontend API client (`frontend/lib/api.ts`)

**Note on enum comparisons:** `ModelType` and `LoRAType` both inherit from `(str, Enum)`, so string comparisons like `config.model_type == "Flux"` work correctly. The `normalize_model_type` validator also handles frontend variants like `'SD15'` -> `'SD1.5'` cleanly.

### 4.2 Known Issues - LoRA Training

**Issue LT-1: wandb_key field exists but is never used**
- **Severity:** Medium (broken feature)
- **Location:** `services/models/training.py:168` (defined), nowhere referenced
- **Problem:** `TrainingConfig.wandb_key` is defined as a config field but never read by `kohya_toml.py` or set as an environment variable in `kohya.py`. W&B integration silently fails for users who set this.
- **Fix:** In `kohya.py` env setup, add `if self.config.wandb_key: env["WANDB_API_KEY"] = self.config.wandb_key` before launching the subprocess.

**Issue LT-2: enable_bucket force-enabled, user preference ignored**
- **Severity:** Low (functionality lock)
- **Location:** `services/trainers/kohya_toml.py:110`
- **Problem:** `dataset["enable_bucket"] = True # Force bucketing enabled` - hard-coded, ignores `self.config.enable_bucket`. Users can't disable bucketing even if they want to (e.g., for fixed-resolution datasets).
- **Fix:** Replace with `dataset["enable_bucket"] = self.config.enable_bucket`
- **Status:** ✅ **Done — verified in code 2026-05-30.** `kohya_toml.py:111` now reads `dataset["enable_bucket"] = self.config.enable_bucket`; the old hardcode survives only as a commented line (95) in the `general` block.

**Issue LT-3: network_train_unet_only added in checkpoint mode**
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Location:** `services/trainers/kohya_toml.py:346`
- **Problem:** `network_train_unet_only` is added to args unconditionally in `_get_training_arguments()`, but it's a LoRA-only parameter. For checkpoint/fine-tune training (`fine_tune.py`, `sdxl_train.py`, etc.) this argument is invalid and may cause Kohya to error out or warn.
- **Fix:** Wrap in `if self.config.training_mode != TrainingMode.CHECKPOINT:` like the network args section already does at line 184.
- **Status:** ✅ **Done — verified in code 2026-05-30.** `kohya_toml.py:384` now reads `if self.config.training_mode != TrainingMode.CHECKPOINT and self.config.network_train_unet_only:` — properly guarded against checkpoint mode.

**Issue LT-4: "Full" LoRA type semantic confusion**
- **Severity:** Low (UX/conceptual)
- **Location:** `services/models/training.py:36`, `services/trainers/kohya_toml.py:270-272`
- **Problem:** `LoRAType.FULL = "Full"` is exposed as a LoRA algorithm option (mapped to `lycoris.kohya` with `algo=full`), but "Full" means native fine-tuning (DreamBooth) which conceptually belongs in checkpoint training mode. Users selecting `training_mode=lora` + `lora_type=Full` get an unusual config that may conflict with `network_train_unet_only=True`.
- **Fix:** ~~(a) auto-switch to checkpoint mode~~ (rejected — there is **no** training-mode toggle on the LoRA tab; checkpoint training is a separate page `/checkpoint-training`, and Dusk confirms there should NOT be a checkpoint switch on the LoRA tab). ~~(b) add validation warning~~ (rejected — bias, see LT-5). **Decision (Dusk, 2026-05-30): (c) relabel for clarity — label change only, keep `algo=full` available.**
- **Status:** ✅ **Done — verified (tsc clean) 2026-06-06.** `LoRAStructureCard.tsx` `Full` description (line ~49) and `TYPE_HINTS.Full` (line ~55) rewritten: now "Full-rank LyCORIS network (algo=full) … still outputs a LoRA-format file — NOT a standalone checkpoint … For native checkpoint fine-tuning, use the Checkpoint Training page." No more "DreamBooth-style" checkpoint misread; `algo=full` still available.
- **Bonus (LT-5 applied to existing hints):** while in this file, pulled the **value-range nudges** from `TYPE_HINTS` — `IA3` ("requires 5e-3–1e-2 LR") and `DyLoRA` ("rank 64+") removed entirely; `Diag-OFT`/`BOFT` **trimmed** to keep the genuine disambiguation ("orthogonal — different from LoRA") and drop the "keep rank 4–16" nudge. Kept the disambiguation/behavioural-fact hints (`Full`, `TLoRA`). The IA3 hint was verified to be half-true lore (not in `lycoris/modules/ia3.py`, contradicted by `lora_ia3-sd15.json` LR 1.0 + Prodigy) — see CLAUDE.md "Empirical Lore — Interrogate It."

**Issue LT-5: No LyCORIS algorithm-specific validation**
- **Severity:** Low (UX)
- **Location:** `api/routes/training.py:33-253`
- **Problem:** No validation warns users about algorithm-specific learning rate ranges (e.g., IA3 needs 5e-3 to 1e-2, much higher than standard LoRA), or about unused parameters (e.g., `conv_dim`/`conv_alpha` only apply to LoCon/LoHa, `factor` only to LoKR).
- **Status:** 🚫 **WON'T DO in the UI — confirmed (Dusk, 2026-06-06).** Re-examined: not just LR-range *warnings* but **even purely informational UI hints** are out. Two parts considered:
  - **(a) per-algorithm LR scale** (IA3 ~5e-3–1e-2, etc.) — algorithm-intrinsic *fact*, not opinion, so it isn't "bias" in the strict sense. **But** as a UI hint it still sends the wrong signal: a "typical: X" next to a field reads as a quiet *should* and nudges behavior — bias-by-suggestion. Out.
  - **(b) no-op-parameter hints** (`conv_dim`/`conv_alpha` only for LoCon/LoHa; `factor` only for LoKR) — knowable from LyCORIS source, but same verdict: more UI hints clutter and confuse more than they help.
- **Where this info SHOULD live:** the project's **own docs/wiki** — reference material users go *find*, not in-form nudges. Deferred to the documentation re-jig (no date). Principle: a *few* good UI hints help; layering on more is net-negative. Generalizes [[feedback-stop-forcing-bias]] — the form must not editorialize, even with true facts.

**Issue LT-6: network_module field is misleading**
- **Severity:** Low (API clarity)
- **Location:** `services/models/training.py:197-199`
- **Problem:** `network_module` is a writable field with default `"networks.lora"` but its docstring says "derived from lora_type". The TOML generator always overrides it via `_get_network_config()`. API users who set this field will see it silently ignored.
- **Status:** ✅ **Resolved via documentation — verified in code 2026-05-30.** `training.py:210-212` now carries an explicit comment: *"network_module is always derived from lora_type… This default is for serialization only; the user-set value is not used in TOML generation."* No longer a silent trap. (Field is still writable-but-ignored by design; could be made read-only later if desired, but no longer misleading.)

**Issue LT-7: Conventional-wisdom value caps & precision limits baked into training UI/validation** *(Dusk, 2026-06-05)*
- **Severity:** Medium (violates the project's own bleeding-edge rule; blocks legitimate expert values)
- **Background:** A pile of academic/"safe-range" guardrails (the Furkan-flavored kind that leaked in from LLM training data, **not** added by us deliberately) are baked into the training form and Zod schema. They directly contradict `CLAUDE.md` → *"Bleeding Edge — Non-Standard Parameters Are Intentional"* (no artificial min/max/step on training params; use `step="any"`; only validate hard errors). This is the same class already rejected in **LT-5** — generalize that decision across the whole form.
- **Symptom Dusk hit (2026-06-05):** on the **Advanced tab**, the **noise** fields can't take precise values like `.357` — they snap because of `step={0.01}`. Confirmed: `AdvancedCard.tsx` `noise_offset` (line 75, `step={0.01}`), and siblings `adaptive_noise_scale` (86) and `multires_noise_discount` (124) same. Separately, **Min SNR gamma won't go above 20** (`min_snr_gamma .max(20)`) — the arbitrary ceiling.
- **Offenders — hard value caps (`frontend/lib/validation.ts`):**
  - `min_snr_gamma` `.max(20)` (the "can't burn it" cap) — line ~292
  - `unet_lr` / `text_encoder_lr` `.max(1, 'seems too high')` — ~189-197
  - `network_dim` / `network_alpha` `.max(1024)` **and `network_alpha` `.int()`** (rejects fractional alpha, which is legitimate) — ~214-216
  - `lr_power` `.max(10)`, `weight_decay` `.max(1)`, `max_grad_norm` `.max(10)`, `clip_skip` `.max(12)`, `guidance_scale` `.max(30)`, `lr_scheduler_number` `.max(100)`, `network_dropout`/`rank_dropout`/`module_dropout` `.max(1)`, etc.
- **Offenders — precision-limiting UI props:** ~137 `min=`/`max=`/`step=` props across the 9 cards in `frontend/components/training/cards/` (AdvancedCard 56, LoRAStructureCard 18, LearningRateCard 13, CaptionCard 12, DatasetCard 11, AugmentationCard 9, OptimizerCard 8, SavingCard 6, MemoryCard 4). The `step={0.01}`/`step={0.1}` ones are what block 3-decimal precision.
- **Offenders — value-judgment nags (remove):** `frontend/components/training/cards/DatasetCard.tsx:103` — *"⚠️ This batch size may exceed your VRAM! Consider reducing to 1-2."* That's conventional-wisdom nagging, not a hard error.
- **NOT bias — keep these:** destructive-action confirms are safety, not bias — `TrainingMonitor.tsx:298` (stop training), `PresetManager.tsx:337` (delete preset), `TrainingDefaults.tsx:48` (reset defaults). Leave them (though the raw `confirm()` calls should become shadcn `AlertDialog` per the a11y rule — separate concern). The `(recommended)` labels in dropdowns are soft informational defaults, not blocks — lower priority, audit only if they read as pushy.
- **Fix:** (1) In `validation.ts`, drop the value-range `.max()`/`.min()` opinions on training params; keep only structural/required checks (non-empty paths, correct type, divisible-by-64 resolution, enum membership). Remove `.int()` from `network_alpha`. (2) In the cards, switch numeric training fields to `step="any"` and remove artificial `max`/`min` (keep `min={0}`/`min={1}` only where a negative/zero is genuinely structurally invalid). (3) Delete the DatasetCard VRAM batch-size warning.
- **Cross-ref:** LT-5 (same anti-bias precedent, already accepted), `CLAUDE.md` Bleeding Edge section, `5.0.95` (validation single-source-of-truth — coordinate so the enum schemas aren't disturbed while loosening the numeric ones).
- **Status:** ✅ **Done — verified (tsc clean) 2026-06-06.** Three parts landed:
  1. **`validation.ts`** — stripped every conventional-range `.max()` ceiling on training params (min_snr_gamma, unet/text_encoder_lr, network_dim/alpha, conv_dim/alpha, dropouts, weight_decay, max_grad_norm, clip_skip, guidance_scale, lr_power, lr_scheduler_number, repeats/epochs/batch/grad_accum, bucket/token caps, etc.); removed `.int()` from `network_alpha`/`conv_alpha` (fractional alpha is legit); made `noise_offset`/`adaptive_noise_scale` bare numbers (negatives are legit). Kept only structural floors (≥1 epoch/batch/repeat, positive LR, divisible-by-64 resolution), enum membership, and required paths.
  2. **`FormFields.tsx` `NumberFormField`** (single choke point for all ~138 numeric fields) — decimal `step` props (0.01/0.1/0.00001) that forced 1–2 decimal places are now upgraded to `step="any"` for full precision (fixes the `.357` snap); whole-number structural steps ≥1 (e.g. resolution's `step={64}`) are still honored; `max` is accepted-but-ignored (documented).
  3. **`DatasetCard.tsx`** — deleted the "⚠️ batch size may exceed your VRAM, reduce to 1-2" nag (kept the neutral VRAM estimate in the field description).
- **Follow-up (cosmetic, low priority):** the now-inert `max={…}` props still sit on ~138 call sites (ignored by the component, documented). A mechanical sweep to delete them would tidy the cards but changes no behavior.

### 4.3 Training Dataset Features (backlog)

These are new capabilities (not bugs) for how datasets feed a LoRA run.

**LT-FEAT-1: Regularization image support**
- **Priority:** Medium (Beta)
- Let a run include a **regularization / class-image** set (Kohya `reg_data_dir` style) to curb overfitting and preserve the base model's prior. Needs: a way to point at / upload a reg-image folder, plumb it into the dataset TOML as a separate subset with `is_reg = true` (and its own `num_repeats`), and a UI field on the training config. Confirm exactly how the vendored sd-scripts expects reg subsets before wiring.

**LT-FEAT-2: Multiple folders per dataset (multi-concept / per-folder activation tags)**
- **Priority:** Medium (Beta)
- Support multiple subfolders within one dataset, each with its **own activation/trigger tag and `num_repeats`**, mapping to Kohya's multi-`subset` dataset config. Touches three layers: the dataset uploader/structure (create + manage subfolders), the TOML generator (emit one `[[datasets.subsets]]` per folder with its `class_tokens`/caption + repeats), and the training UI (per-folder trigger + repeats inputs). Larger than it looks because it changes the dataset → TOML shape, not just one field.

### 4.4 torchao Optional Dependency (vendored optimizers)

**Priority:** Low (decision needed)

The vendored optimizer package (`trainer/derrian_backend/custom_scheduler/LoraEasyCustomOptimizer/low_bit_optim/`) is torchao-based, and `train_util.py`'s optimizer-signature introspection imports that chain — but `torchao` is in **none** of our requirements. Result: a **non-fatal** `WARNING ... determine default orthograd ... No module named 'torchao'` on every run (seen with CAME), after which it falls back to defaults (orthograd off, torchao state-storage auto-config skipped). Harmless for CAME and standard optimizers.

Verified: `orthograd`/`torchao` appear **only** in the vendored backend — nothing in our generators, presets, or frontend forces them. The warning is pure upstream optimizer-package behavior.

**Decision:** add `torchao` (enables the low-bit/torchao optimizers + orthograd auto-detect, silences the warning) vs. leave it out (heavy, torch-version-coupled dep that CAME doesn't need). If added: pin to our torch version and test on Windows + VastAI + RunPod first. This is ours to own — the vendored backend carries **our own patches** (applied ~Mar–May 2026 after pulled upstream updates broke things), so don't wait on upstream.

**Code findings (verified in `library/train_util.py:prepare_optimizer`, ~line 7589–7650, on 2026-05-30):**
- **orthograd does NOT depend on torchao.** `apply_orthograd` is detected (line 7646) and applied at the **network/param level** via `network.prepare_optimizer_params(..., apply_orthograd=...)`; the implementation `_paper_orthograd` is pure torch (imported from `LoraEasyCustomOptimizer/.utils`). The torchao ImportError only makes `inspect.signature(optimizer_class.__init__)` fail → fallback to `{}` (line 7642–7644) → can't auto-detect an orthograd *default* from the signature. Explicit `use_orthograd=True` still applies. So **orthograd is a red herring for the torchao decision.**
- **What torchao actually unlocks: `state_storage_dtype`** (line 7648+) — low-bit/quantized **optimizer-state storage** (8/4-bit, fp8). This is precisely the `state_storage_dtype=bfloat16 state_storage_device=cuda` that 4070-class **CAME** users need for VRAM (cross-ref the Anima §7.2 note + PR-1). Without torchao the low_bit_optim chain (`subclass_8bit/4bit/fp8`) can't import.
- **Why torchao surfaces — NOT a CAME dependency (clarified 2026-06-06):** `came.py` imports only torch + pytorch_optimizer; CAME is kozistr-based (`came.py:1-3`) + neggles stochastic rounding. torchao gets pulled in purely because the vendored `LoraEasyCustomOptimizer` collection's **eager `__init__`** imports its whole roster, including AO low-bit optimizers (copied from pytorch/ao) that hard-import torchao. That eager `__init__` is **67372a's fork's** (`refresh` branch); derrian's *original* had an **empty `__init__`** and never pulled torchao. So it's not derrian's packaging, not CAME — it's the fork's roster.
- **Per research (2026-06-06): the upstream we vendor has already moved on.** 67372a migrated installs pip→**uv** and now installs torchao via `--index-strategy unsafe-best-match` (2026-05-30) — resolving it against the installed torch instead of a hard pin, neutralizing the version-coupling risk. Our vendored snapshot is simply **behind**; the `No module named 'torchao'` warning is a *staleness artifact*, not a real problem (training proceeds; it's caught at `train_util.py:7639-7643` during orthograd-default introspection).
- **DECISION (Dusk, 2026-06-06) — SUPERSEDED 2026-06-22 (torchao WAS added standalone as `torchao==0.7.0`; see Status below): do NOT add torchao standalone / by hand.** Chasing torchao via more hand-vendoring is the exact "chase vendored updates by hand" pain we're trying to escape. **The right answer is the submodule strategy → see Section 20.** Submodule the backend and we inherit torchao (and everything else 67372a ships) naturally, far more often, **and align better with GPL-3.0 licensing** (reference upstream rather than copy GPL source into our tree). torchao's fate is folded into the §20 backend-delivery decision — resolved there, not here. The earlier "add it for CAME VRAM" lean is **withdrawn** (it also fought the CAME bf16-state NaN guard at `kohya_toml.py:515`).
- **Status:** ✅ **ADDED standalone (2026-06-22) as `torchao==0.7.0` in `requirements_base.txt`.** Supersedes the 2026-06-06 "won't add / fold into §20" decision: the submodule (§20) is now PARKED, and patch-update is the chosen delivery method (§20 revised 2026-06-22), so adding torchao directly IS the sanctioned path — not the hand-chasing it was once feared to be. **Why 0.7.0 specifically:** earliest version exposing both `torchao.utils.TorchAOBaseTensor` + `get_available_devices` (both on the eager import path via `adam.py → low_bit_optim → cpu_offload`); hard-pinned because unpinned grabs latest (0.17+, needs torch≥2.6, breaks on our torch 2.4.1 base = the "too high" install failure). **Cross-platform verified:** Linux=manylinux wheel, Windows/Mac=`py3-none-any` pure-Python wheel; torch-2.4.1-safe because its `_C` load is `try/except`'d and we use only the pure-Python `torchao.utils`. Zero torch dependency → never drags/pins torch. **Usage:** `state_storage_dtype`/`state_storage_device` via the freeform `optimizer_args` field (not auto-injected — CAME bf16-state NaN guard at `kohya_toml.py:515` stands).

### 4.5 Custom Optimizer Audit — Wiring Solid, Pins Drift *(Dusk, 2026-06-05)*

Full trace of the schedule-free / CAME / custom-optimizer chain on 2026-06-05. **Headline: the wiring is complete and correct end-to-end; the only real gap is dependency-pin hygiene.**

**✅ Verified solid (no action):**
- **Schedule-free fully wired:** frontend dropdown → `validation.ts` `OPTIMIZER_VALUES` → backend `OptimizerType` (`services/models/training.py:68-70`) → `CUSTOM_OPTIMIZER_PATHS` (`services/trainers/kohya_toml.py:236-238`) → vendored native support (`train_util.py:5454-5468`). (Supersedes the stale "schedule-free backlogged, needs enum/path entries" note — that work is done.)
- **The SF saved-LoRA gotcha is handled:** native schedule-free optimizers must switch to `.eval()` before save/sample or the saved weights are the wrong (train-mode) iterate. `train_network.py` calls `optimizer_eval_fn()` before every save/sample (lines 1880, 2080, 2217, 2264) and `optimizer_train_fn()` after (1889, 2132, 2248). Same pattern in `flux_train.py` / `anima_train.py`. SDXL/SD15 SF training produces correct weights.
- **CAME NaN guard present:** `kohya_toml.py:449-450` deliberately does not inject `state_storage_dtype/device` for CAME (bf16 state → NaN; fp32 default is correct). See §4.4 tension note above.

**⚠️ LT-OPT-1: Dependency pins disagree across three requirements files**
- **Severity:** Low–Medium (reproducibility / CLAUDE.md "pin versions" rule)
- **Background:** the installer editable-installs the vendored dirs (`installer.py:606-612`) and installs `requirements_base.txt` — so **`requirements_base.txt` is the file that actually sets versions**; the pins inside `sd_scripts/requirements.txt` and `lycoris/requirements-kohya.txt` are effectively decorative (the vendored backend was never a real submodule, so those loose `.txt` pins don't drive the install). CodeRabbit recently added pins (good) — finish making them consistent.
- **Drift (effective = `requirements_base.txt`):**
  - `came-pytorch` — **unpinned** in base; vendored says `~=0.1.3`. Pin base to `~=0.1.3`. (A breaking release would silently break installs.)
  - `schedulefree` — base `==1.4`, vendored `~=1.4.1`; we install the *older* one than the code targets. Bump base to `~=1.4.1`.
  - `pytorch_optimizer` — base/sd_scripts `3.10.0`, but `lycoris/requirements-kohya.txt` carries a **stale `==3.1.2` pin + comment** ("init_group abstract method added in 3.6.0") implying LyCORIS wanted `<3.6.0`. We run 3.10.0 and `sd_scripts` agrees, so the fork was presumably updated — but the stale pin/comment is a trap. Confirm LyCORIS runs clean on 3.10.0, then delete the stale pin/comment.
- **Unconfirmed (1-line check):** assumed `pip install -e` ignores the vendored `.txt` pins (reads `setup.py`/`pyproject` `install_requires` instead). Confirm LyCORIS's `setup.py` doesn't `-r requirements-kohya.txt` before relying on "base wins."
- **Status:** ✅ **Done — verified 2026-06-06.** `requirements_base.txt`: `came-pytorch` → `came-pytorch~=0.1.3` (was unpinned), `schedulefree==1.4` → `schedulefree~=1.4.1` (matches vendored). **Stale LyCORIS pin resolved by confirmation, not edit:** `lycoris/setup.py:13` declares `install_requires=["torch", "einops", "toml", "tqdm"]` and does NOT read `requirements-kohya.txt`, so that file's `pytorch_optimizer==3.1.2` pin is **decorative** (pip never sees it on editable install) — "base wins" confirmed. Left the vendored file untouched (it's overwritten on every upstream sync; editing it is pointless + against the don't-touch-vendored rule). `pytorch_optimizer==3.10.0` in base stands.

**🟡 LT-OPT-2: Schedule-free scheduler default (optional, low priority)**
- Schedule-free optimizers self-schedule and want a `constant` LR scheduler; the frontend default is `cosine_with_restarts` with no smart default. **Per the bleeding-edge/anti-bias rule (LT-7, LT-5): a smart *default* when an SF optimizer is selected is acceptable; a *warning/block* is not.** Also note `flux_train_network.md:580` — validation loss is unsupported with SF optimizers, so that UI combo silently no-ops. Low priority; smart-default only, never a nag.

**🟢 LT-OPT-3: Auto-populate optimizer dropdown from a single source (low priority, Dusk 2026-06-22)**
- Today adding an optimizer is a TWO-file edit: `OPTIMIZER_VALUES` (`validation.ts`) for the schema/type, AND the hardcoded `{ value, label, description }` list in `OptimizerCard.tsx` (constrained via `satisfies` but not generated). The "only change needed" comment was doc-rot — fixed 2026-06-22.
- **Refactor:** make `OPTIMIZER_VALUES` an array of `{ value, label, description }` objects; derive the Zod enum (`z.enum(values.map(v => v.value))`) AND the dropdown from it. Not free because the labels/descriptions carry real UX value and must relocate, not vanish. Clean afternoon job, behind trainer correctness.

**🟡 LT-OPT-4: Wire the 3 deferred schedule-free/wrapper optimizers (Dusk 2026-06-22)**
- `AdamWScheduleFreePlus`, `NorMuonScheduleFree`, `SODAWrapper` were pulled from 67372a + staged in-tree (commit `f479989`) but NOT exposed. (`AMUSE`/`MODA`/`SODA` — standard — shipped exposed in `2e7a156`.)
- **The dispatch problem:** kohya detects schedule-free by name → routes to the external `schedulefree` package (`train_util.py:5454`); `NorMuonScheduleFree`'s name would misroute, and SF opts need the `optimizer_eval_fn()`/`optimizer_train_fn()` train/eval toggle that native SF gets (see §4.5 line re: `train_network.py` save/sample eval calls) — custom-path resolution may not provide it → saved weights would be the wrong train-mode iterate. Verify/handle that toggle for custom-path SF before exposing, or they train silently wrong. `SODAWrapper` purpose still unconfirmed (possibly SF too).

## 5. Miscellaneous Bug Fixes for Beta

### 5.0 WandB / Logging UI Missing Entirely

**Issue UI-1: WandB and logging fields have no UI in the training form** — ✅ **Done 2026-05-25**
- **Status:** `LoggingCard.tsx` added; WandB/logging fields configurable in UI. Paired with LT-1 (wandb_key wired to env).

### 5.0.5 Dashboard — Bulldoze + Rebuild

**Issue UI-2: Dashboard is a first-day, zero-context wrapper artifact** — ⏳ **Not started (later — ~2 months)**
- **Severity:** Low (current dashboard is acceptable/cleaner now — just incomplete, not blocking)
- **Location:** `frontend/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
- **Plan:** Don't patch — **rebuild from scratch.** Current dashboard predates real project context; incremental fixes aren't worth it.
- **Rebuild requirements (carry forward):**
  - Surface all real routes — currently missing: `/checkpoint-training`, `/dataset/auto-tag`, `/dataset/tags`, `/dataset-uppy`, `/huggingface-upload`, `/changelog`, `/models/browse`.
  - If it includes an Active Jobs widget: take `Job[]` from day one (one job now, many once §5.1 queue lands) — single-slot = a UI rewrite later.
- **Blocked by:** backend work finished + a database layer landing first. Sequence after those.

### 5.0.7 Listener/Request Cancellation Console Noise

**Issue UI-3: "Listener cancelled" / AbortError messages on page navigation** — ✅ **Done 2026-05-20**
- **Status:** Resolved — AbortController refactor landed, errors caught and suppressed. Residual noise attributed to low-RAM thrashing (not reproduced on adequate RAM). Won't chase further.

### 5.0.8 Training Log Polling - Updates Feel Inconsistent

**Issue UI-4: Training logs only update "when they feel like it"** — ✅ **Done 2026-04-30**
- **Status:** Fixed-cadence + visibility-aware polling implemented in `api.ts:pollLogs()`. Backend uses Python `-u` flag. Residual sporadicity = backend emit cadence (Kohya/accelerate buffering), not poller. Re-check only if regresses.

### 5.0.9 Training Monitor — tqdm ETA and Step Progress Parsing

**Issue UI-5: No ETA, step count, or percentage in the training monitor** — ✅ **Done 2026-05-30**
- **Status:** Backend parses tqdm → `step_progress` events; `TrainingMonitor.tsx` consumes them with `getTimeRemaining()`. Minor residual: progress "bursts at end" (drain logic, 15s window) — expected, low priority.

### 5.0.95 Validation Schema / UI Dropdown Single Source of Truth

**Issue PR-0: OptimizerSchema and LRSchedulerSchema drift from UI dropdown**
- **Severity:** Medium (recurring bug class — caused #369)
- **Flagged by:** CodeRabbit on PR #370
- **Problem:** `OptimizerSchema` and `LRSchedulerSchema` in `validation.ts` are separate string arrays from the dropdown options in `OptimizerCard.tsx`. Every time a new optimizer/scheduler is added to the UI, it must be manually added to the schema too — and that drift is exactly what broke CAME/Compass/schedule-free optimizers before PR #370.
- **Fix:** Export `OPTIMIZER_VALUES` and `LRSCHEDULER_VALUES` as `as const` tuples from `validation.ts`. Build the Zod schemas from those constants. `OptimizerCard.tsx` dropdown keeps its own labels/descriptions but TypeScript can enforce values only come from `OPTIMIZER_VALUES`. Future additions require touching one place.
- **Status:** ✅ **Done — verified 2026-06-06.** `validation.ts` exports `OPTIMIZER_VALUES` + `LR_SCHEDULER_VALUES` as `as const` tuples and builds both Zod enums from them (`OptimizerSchema`/`LRSchedulerSchema`). Both dropdowns are typed against those tuples — `OptimizerCard.tsx:70` `satisfies Array<{ value: OptimizerValue }>` and `LearningRateCard.tsx:95` `satisfies Array<{ value: LRSchedulerValue }>` — so any drift between a dropdown and the schema is a **compile error**. Single-source-of-truth confirmed.

### 5.0.96 Legacy Preset Audit — bmaltais Format Migration

**Issue PR-2: ~30 built-in presets still use old nested `config:{}` format with legacy field names**
- **Severity:** Medium (all old-format presets were silently broken before PR #370)
- **Background:** Most built-in presets were imported from bmaltais's Kohya SS gradio scripts. They use legacy field names (`optimizer`, `epoch`, `learning_rate`, `batch_size`, `lr_warmup`, `max_resolution`, `dataset_repeats`) nested under a `config:` block — a completely different schema from the current `TrainingConfig`.
- **Current state:** PR #370 added `normalizeLegacyPresetFields()` so these presets now *load* correctly via the mapping layer. But the files themselves are still in the old format, which is fragile.
- **Fix:** Audit all presets in `presets/` and convert any still using the old nested format to the flat format used by newer presets (e.g. `lora_SDXL - Illustrious-XL CAME Conservative v1.0.json`). Remove obsolete fields, fix legacy field names, ensure types are correct (strings → numbers where needed).
- **Status:** 🟡 **Partially done — verified 2026-06-06.** The `normalizeLegacyPresetFields()` shim (PR #370) is present, so legacy presets **load** correctly. BUT the migration deliverable itself isn't done: **31 preset files still use the nested `config:{}` legacy format** (e.g. `lora_SDXL - LoRA AI_characters standard v1.0.json`, the `EDG_*` set, `lora_lokr-sd15.json`, …). They work only via the shim. **Outstanding:** convert those 31 files to flat format (mechanical, low-risk, no GPU) so they don't depend on the compatibility layer. Not done in this session to keep the PR focused.

### 5.0.97 Categorical Preset Library Expansion — Peer-LoRA Study *(Dusk, 2026-06-09)*

**Goal: add new *categorical* presets covering training patterns that are common across real-world peer LoRAs but that our `presets/` folder doesn't represent yet.**
- **Severity:** Low (library enrichment, not a bug) — but high *value* for users picking a starting point.
- **Status:** ⏳ Parked — corpus read + tooling built, the actual gap-walk and preset authoring are not started. (Captured on a flat-brain day; resume fresh.)

**Method — IMPORTANT, this is the part that's easy to get wrong:**
- **Dusk leads, section by section, qualitatively.** The empirical layer is *his knowledge of what each LoRA actually is* (subject, what worked, output quality) — the metadata can't see that. He walks a section, names the gap.
- **The metadata stats are BACKING, not the driver.** They sanity-check a hunch; they don't lead and they shouldn't clog the flow. No aggregate tables / histograms unless explicitly asked — that's what derailed the first pass.
- **Authority order:** Dusk's hands-on training results > paper-reading of preset fields. Community experts (Novowels, Citron, kudou-reira) are authoritative — don't second-guess their values.
- **Presets don't pin training outcome:** repeats are dataset-side, steps are derived, batch matters — so matching another LoRA's LR/dim does **not** make a new preset redundant. Coverage is about *kind of recipe*, not exact numbers.

**Tooling already built (local scratch in `temp/`, header-only, no deps):**
- `read_loras.py` — reads safetensors `__metadata__` header-only; emits per-file summary + `lora_study_full.csv`.
- `lora_study_full.csv` — all 123 peer LoRAs, one row each (optimizer / dim·alpha / unet_lr / scheduler / network).
- `preset_gaps.py` — flags optimizer×model combos peers use that our `presets/` has **no** preset for (the new-preset hunt). Backing only.
- `provenance.py` — checks whether a cluster (e.g. the Adafactor-fixed group) is one source or many.

**Corpus:** 123 peer LoRAs at `C:\Users\dusk\Downloads\Loras to study for Claude`.

**Candidate clusters spotted as starting backing (NOT conclusions — Dusk's read decides):**
- **Adafactor-fixed workhorse** — `dim32 / a16 / lr 5e-4 / cosine_with_restarts`, plain `lora` on SDXL/Illustrious. Most common signature in the corpus; likely one tool/author (that's what `provenance.py` is for). Check coverage vs `finetune_adafactor.json` / `folk_horror_style_adafactor.json`.
- **Flux/Chroma low-dim** — `dim2 / a16 / lr 5e-4 / cosine_restarts`, `lora_flux`. Distinctive high alpha:dim. Check vs `chroma_style_experimental.json` / `flux_*`.
- **Prodigy Illustrious/PDXL** — `lr 1.0` adaptive, dim 8–32, cosine/constant. Check vs `kudou-reira_prodigy.json` / `faetastic_sdxl_prodigy.json`.
- **CAME NoobAI** — `dim8 / a4 / lr ~3–6e-5 / cosine` — likely already covered by `came_character_*`.

---

### 5.1 Preset Optimizer Args Contamination

**Issue PR-1: optimizer_args field picks up general training args from community presets**
- **Severity:** Medium (causes cryptic training failures)
- **Status:** ✅ **Done — verified 2026-06-06.** Inspected every `optimizer_args` value across all presets — none carry contaminated training-level args anymore (no `state_storage_dtype=`/`state_storage_device=`/`mixed_precision=`/`fp8_base=` etc.); all values are legitimate optimizer args (`weight_decay`, `betas`, `eps`, `decouple`, `d0`, `d_coef`, `scale_parameter`, …). The Citron-style precision/device contamination is gone. (Tokenizer robustness for *parsing* those args is tracked separately in PR-1b.)
- **User-reported:** Citron's Adafactor preset stuffed precision/device args (`state_storage_dtype=bfloat16 state_storage_device=cuda` style) into `optimizer_args`. Adafactor then threw `ValueError: not enough values to unpack` because those aren't valid optimizer args.
- **Root cause:** Community presets (and possibly our own) miscategorise general training args as optimizer_args. These are actually top-level training fields (`mixed_precision`, `fp8_base`, etc.) that got bundled into the freetext `optimizer_args` blob.
- **Workaround:** Manually clear `optimizer_args` before training if switching optimizers or loading community presets.

**Fixes:**
1. **Preset cleanup** — audit all bundled presets, move any precision/device args out of `optimizer_args` into proper top-level fields
2. **UX warning** — when `optimizer_args` is non-empty and optimizer type changes, warn the user: "These args may be specific to a different optimizer — clear them?"
3. **Validation** — before training starts, validate that `optimizer_args` entries look like actual optimizer args (key=value pairs that the selected optimizer recognises), not training-level settings
4. **Community preset naming** — if a preset bundles optimizer-specific args, the name should make that clear (e.g. "Citron Adafactor - SDXL" not just "Citron")

**Issue PR-1b: optimizer_args copied from LoRA metadata crash the trainer** *(Dusk, 2026-06-06)*
- **Status:** ✅ **Done — verified 2026-06-06.**
- **Trigger:** copying optimizer args from a reference LoRA's metadata to emulate its training style. Metadata formats them **comma-separated** with **spaces inside tuple values** — e.g. `weight_decay=0.08,betas=(0.99, 0.999, 0.99995)`. Our generator tokenised with `shlex.split` (whitespace-only), which shattered the tuple into fragments lacking exactly one `=`, so the vendored parser (`train_util.py:7610`, `key, value = arg.split("=")`) crashed with `ValueError: ... unpack`. Same crash *class* as PR-1, different *trigger* (metadata paste, not preset contamination) — so the earlier fix didn't cover it.
- **Fix (BOTH config generators — Python and Node):** a paren-aware tokenizer that splits on commas/whitespace only at the **top level** (separators inside `()`/`[]`/`{}` are preserved), then strips inner whitespace → clean `key=value` tokens. Handles metadata-style (comma + spaces) AND Kohya CLI-style (space, no inner spaces); clean presets unchanged. Structural-hard-error hardening, not bias.
  - **Python:** `services/trainers/kohya_toml.py` — new `_tokenize_optimizer_args()` replaces `shlex.split`; removed the now-unused `import shlex`.
  - **Node:** `frontend/lib/node-services/config-service.ts` (the "ported from kohya_toml.py" training-config generator) had the **same bug** — `config.optimizer_args.trim().split(/\s+/)` shattered tuples AND its `weight_decay`-injection check then ran on the fragments. New `tokenizeOptimizerArgs()` (line-for-line port of the Python one) replaces it.
- **`network_args` checked, NOT affected:** verified on both backends — it's built from hardcoded per-algo lists (`['algo=…']`) + individually-typed conv/block fields, never a freetext paste blob, so it can't hit this crash. No fix needed (corrected an earlier guess that it was a freetext blob).
- **Regression caught during PR re-validation (2026-06-06):** the first cut of the tokenizer (paren-aware only) would have **broken two existing preset formats** that the old `shlex.split` handled — **quoted args** (`"weight_decay=0.1" "betas=0.9,0.99"`) and **paren-less comma tuples** (`betas=0.9,0.99`). Revised the tokenizer to also be **quote-aware** (strip quotes, never split inside them) and to **merge `=`-less fragments** back into the preceding token (re-joining paren-less comma tuples). Both Python (`kohya_toml.py`) and Node (`config-service.ts`) updated to match.
- **Verified:** tested the real Python function against a **13-case matrix of actual preset formats** (quoted, paren tuple, bracket tuple, bare-comma tuple, AdaFactor flags, the metadata paste, empty) — all produce clean `key=value` tokens AND survive the simulated vendored `arg.split("=")` + `ast.literal_eval`. Node tokenizer parity-tested against the same cases + `tsc --noEmit` clean. ⏳ **Not yet run end-to-end on a real CAME job** — that's Dusk's to run (only he can launch CAME training).

### 5.1 HuggingFace Upload - Form State Doesn't Persist

**Issue HF-1: HF upload form loses all data on page navigation** — ✅ **Done 2026-04-30**
- **Status:** Form state migrated to Zustand persist; token pre-filled from settings; owner/repoType persist in localStorage.

### 5.2 Cross-Tab Form Persistence — App-Wide Gap

**Issue FP-1: Most forms lose their state on navigation (broader than HF-1)** — ⏳ **Not started**
- **Severity:** Medium (recurring UX pain across the app)
- **Problem:** HF-1 fixed HF upload page, but ComfyUI Generate, training form, dataset/auto-tag, batch/util forms still lose state on navigation.
- **Approach:** Standardize Zustand `persist` pattern per-form (matching HF-1). Storage per field: localStorage for convenience defaults; sessionStorage/settings for sensitive; never persist per-run transient state.
- **Priority:** ComfyUI Generate persistence most-wanted.

### 5.3 SyntaxWarning Log Noise — Escape Sequences *(Dusk, 2026-06-05)*

**Issue SW-1: `invalid escape sequence` warnings flood training/tagging logs** — ✅ **Done 2026-06-06**
- **SW-1a:** `tag_images_by_wd14_tagger.py:881` → raw string; `python -W error::SyntaxWarning -m py_compile` clean.
- **SW-1b:** `kohya.py:_build_env()` sets `PYTHONWARNINGS=ignore::SyntaxWarning` for training subprocess only (vendored silenced, ours still surface). No vendored patches.

### 5.4 Generate Tab Falls Back to Literal ComfyUI *(Dusk, 2026-06-05)*

**Issue GEN-1: Generate page route collides with ComfyUI proxy prefix** — ✅ **Done 2026-06-06**
- **Root cause:** `/comfyui` route shadowed by `server.js` proxy exact-match.
- **Fix:** `app/comfyui/page.tsx` → `app/generate/page.tsx` (route `/generate`), navbar link updated. LoRA Manager links and proxy rules unchanged. `tsc` clean.
- **Follow-up:** tighten `COMFYUI_ROOT_PREFIXES` (`/checkpoints`, etc.) so generic names can't shadow future routes.

## 6.5 Batch Downloader

**Issue BD-1: Model sourcing is fragile and region-dependent**
- **Priority:** Beta+ (nice to have, but solves a real accessibility problem)
- **Status:** Not started
- **Motivation:** Civitai's API geoblocks certain regions (UK datacenter IPs get 451'd due to UK Online Safety Act compliance). Users shouldn't need a working Civitai API to download models — they should be able to paste any link and have it work.

### Concept

A dedicated **Batch Downloader** page where users paste a list of URLs or magnet links (one per line) and the app routes each to the right downloader automatically:

| Link type | Downloader |
|-----------|-----------|
| `https://huggingface.co/...` | `huggingface-cli` / `hf_hub_download` |
| `magnet:?xt=...` | `aria2c` |
| `https://civitai.com/...` | Existing Civitai API (with token) |
| Any other HTTP/HTTPS | `aria2c` (better than wget for resumable downloads) |
| Google Drive | `gdown` |

### UI Design

- Large textarea: paste URLs one per line, with **inline hashtag routing per
  line (A1111 BatchLinks style)**: `#model <url>`, `#lora <url>`, `#vae <url>`,
  `#dataset <url>`, `#output <url>`
- Global destination dropdown as the *default* for lines with no hashtag
- Progress list showing each download's status as it runs
- aria2c is already installed on VastAI/RunPod instances (required by existing workflow)

### Inspiration

Inspired by the A1111 `BatchLinks` extension which used `#destination` hashtag syntax to route downloads. **Dusk's vision (confirmed 2026-05-25): keep the hashtag syntax as the primary routing UX** (`#model <url>`, `#lora <url>`, etc.) — it's faster for power users pasting mixed lists — with a global dropdown only as the default for un-hashtagged lines. (Earlier draft proposed replacing hashtags with a dropdown; that was wrong — the hashtag flow is the point.)

**Reality check (2026-05-25):** the current `/models` download UI is just a card of links, NOT this paste-and-route batch tool. BD-1 is genuinely not started.

### Implementation notes
- Backend: new `POST /api/utilities/batch-download` endpoint that accepts a list of `{url, destination}` objects, spawns aria2c/hf-cli/gdown as appropriate per URL, streams progress back
- Frontend: new page at `frontend/app/batch-download/page.tsx`
- aria2c already present on instances — no new provisioning needed
- gdown may need `pip install gdown` added to requirements
- No torrent tracker/indexer integration — users provide their own links. Completely neutral technology.

## 7. EQ VAE / Reflection Padding Support

### 7.1 Background

EQ VAEs (e.g. `KBlueLeaf/EQ-SDXL-VAE`, `Anzhc/MS-LC-EQ-D-VR_VAE`) require reflection padding on their Conv2d layers instead of the default zero padding. Without it, they produce edge artifacts. The fix is applied post-load by mutating `module.padding_mode = "reflect"` on every Conv2d with non-zero padding.

Reference: https://github.com/kohya-ss/sd-scripts/issues/2189

### VAE-EQ-1: SDXL EQ VAE Support

**Priority:** Nice to Have (Beta+)  
**Status:** Not started

Jelosus2's fork of sd-scripts has a clean 15-line implementation (`library/sdxl_train_util.py`):

```python
def vae_with_reflection(vae):
    for module in vae.modules():
        if isinstance(module, torch.nn.Conv2d):
            pad_h, pad_w = module.padding if isinstance(module.padding, tuple) else (module.padding, module.padding)
            if pad_h > 0 or pad_w > 0:
                module.padding_mode = "reflect"
    return vae
```

And a `--vae_reflection` CLI arg in `train_network.py`.

**Our vendored backend** (`trainer/derrian_backend/sd_scripts/`) does NOT have this patch. It only needs to be ported to `library/sdxl_train_util.py` + add `--vae_reflection` arg.

**Files to change:**
- `trainer/derrian_backend/sd_scripts/library/sdxl_train_util.py` — add `vae_with_reflection()` + call in `load_target_model()`
- `trainer/derrian_backend/sd_scripts/train_network.py` — add `--vae_reflection` arg
- `services/models/training.py` — add `vae_reflection: bool = False`
- `services/trainers/kohya_toml.py` — write `vae_reflection = true` for SDXL when set
- Frontend: add checkbox in training form (SDXL-only, shown conditionally)

### VAE-EQ-2: Anima Qwen-Image VAE Reflection Padding

**Priority:** Nice to Have (Beta+)  
**Status:** Needs research

The Qwen-Image VAE used by Anima is a different architecture (16-channel, 8x spatial downscale) loaded via `library/qwen_image_autoencoder_kl.py`, not `sdxl_train_util.py`. Whether reflection padding applies and what effect it has on Anima training quality needs verification.

**Research needed:** Check if Circlestone Labs' Anima documentation mentions EQ VAE or reflection padding. Check `qwen_image_autoencoder_kl.py` Conv2d layer padding values to see if the patch would even touch anything meaningful.

### VAE-EQ-3: HakuLatent — Long-Horizon Research Item

**Priority:** Future / Research only  
**Status:** Track, do not implement yet  
**Reference:** https://github.com/KohakuBlueleaf/HakuLatent (Apache-2.0)

HakuLatent is KohakuBlueleaf's Python framework for *training* VAEs with EQ (equivariance) regularization — it is the upstream source of the EQ VAEs that VAE-EQ-1 and VAE-EQ-2 are about consuming. It applies rotation/scale/crop/affine transforms during VAE training to produce more geometry-consistent latent spaces.

**What it is not:** A Kohya SS plugin, a LoRA tool, or anything with a web UI integration surface. It produces better VAEs; our job is using those VAEs correctly (reflection padding).

**Plausible future connection:** If the project ever adds VAE fine-tuning (training or adapting a VAE on a custom dataset — e.g. improving a domain-specific VAE for a character artist's style), HakuLatent would be the correct library to wrap. This is a research-grade, long-tail feature.

**Current status of the library:** Active WIP, no stable releases, explicit TODO list with unfinished trainers. Not ready to integrate even if we wanted to.

**When to revisit:** After VAE-EQ-1 and VAE-EQ-2 land and users start asking "can I train my own EQ VAE here?"

### 7.2 Session Notes (2026-04-15) — Anima Audit

During an Anima support audit, the following bug was found and **fixed**:

**FIXED: `networks.lora` → `networks.lora_anima` bug (`services/trainers/kohya_toml.py`)**
- `_get_network_config()` was returning `networks.lora` for all standard LoRA, including Anima
- Anima requires `networks.lora_anima` (confirmed by official docs + real training metadata)
- Using `networks.lora` would train wrong layer sets entirely — silently broken output
- Fix: added `ModelType.ANIMA` check in both the LoRA case and the default fallback

**Anima support status post-fix:** Complete for basic training. All required args (qwen3 path, AE path, per-layer LRs, timestep/flow args, blocks_to_swap) are wired. Default tokenizer configs (`configs/t5_old/`, `configs/qwen3_06b/`) are bundled. Training scripts exist. One minor gap: `optimizer_args` UI description says "JSON" but Kohya expects space-separated `key=value` pairs — relevant for CAME users needing `state_storage_dtype=bfloat16 state_storage_device=cuda` for 4070-class GPUs.

---

## 7.9 Hardcoded Presets Not Wired Into Training Submit Flow

**Priority:** ~~High — blocks actual training~~  
**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED 2026-05-30** — presets fixed; loading a preset and hitting Train submits correctly.
- **Root cause:** Hardcoded presets in `useTrainingForm.ts` populated form visually but didn't wire to submit handler.
- **Fix applied:** Migrated to proper JSON preset system in `presets/`.

## 8. Anima Deep Dive — Research Session Needed

**Priority:** ~~Beta (before Anima is considered properly supported)~~  
**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED 2026-05-30** — Anima works now (confirmed by Dusk). Historical context preserved in git history.
- **Issue was:** `size mismatch` on `layers.27.mlp.gate_proj.weight` — wrong LLM/text encoder loaded.
- **Resolution:** Correct file wiring + `networks.lora_anima` already in place.
- **ARCHITECTURE.md** still a good idea for future context — track separately.

## 8. Session Notes (2026-04-30) — Priority for Next Week

### URGENT: Full Training Logs (next 1-2 sessions)
Training logs are essentially broken in production — the monitor dies early, stdout doesn't flush, and users have no idea what's happening mid-run. Confirmed today that a training can run for HOURS with zero visible progress (Adafactor + 305 images + 10 epochs on a 4090 took well over an hour with zero UI feedback). This is the single most important UX fix for beta.

Fixes needed in priority order:
1. **PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1** on Kohya subprocess (UI-4 backend part) — single biggest impact
2. **tqdm line parser** (UI-5) — surface step count, ETA, it/s in the monitor
3. **Training monitor reconnect** — if the monitor component dies, user should be able to re-attach to a running job by job ID without refreshing the whole page

### Calculator Enhancement — Optimizer + LR Aware Step Guidance
The step calculator currently uses basic Kohya math. Proposal: make it optimizer- and LR-aware so it gives rough but useful guidance on target step counts:

**LR → steps relationship (the big one):**
- LR and step count are in direct tension: higher LR = more work per step = fewer steps needed to reach convergence
- The calculator should take LR as an input and adjust recommended steps/epochs accordingly
- This is more impactful than optimizer choice — LR drives the curve, optimizer affects how cleanly you ride it

**Optimizer adjustment (rough, vibes-based until we have more data):**
- AdamW8bit: baseline (1.0x)
- CAME: converges faster and burns in more aggressively — approx 0.6–0.7x steps for equivalent result; small datasets especially vulnerable to overtrain
- Adafactor (fixed LR): slower per step, more conservative — approx 1.2–1.3x
- Prodigy/DAdaptation: self-adjusting LR so step count guidance is less applicable

**Other inputs already planned:**
- Dataset size × repeats × batch size → total steps
- Resolution effect on VRAM and speed

Not exact science — label everything as "rough guide." Even a "CAME + small dataset: consider reducing epochs by 30%" hint would have saved two undertrained LoRAs. Discovered from real training runs May 2026.

### Hardcoded Presets Migration (section 7.9)
High priority — confirmed blocks training silently. Migrate all presets from `useTrainingForm.ts` into proper JSON files in `presets/`. This fixes the silent training failure AND the PR-1 optimizer_args contamination in one shot.

## 9. Session Notes

### 2026-05-25 — ComfyUI Generate UI polish + doc reconciliation

**Shipped:** ComfyUI Generate UI improvements (queue-runs, 400 error parsing, navbar LoRA Manager link), `extra_model_paths.yaml` installer support, ZIP upload chunking fix, Models page delete → AlertDialog.

**Findings:** LoRA Manager `Checkpoint Loader` validates against scanned cache (not CivitAI metadata). Fix = force rescan in LoRA Manager. Decision: build in-app model manager hooking LoRA Manager API (fold into Civitai downloader page), add ArcEnCiel source.

**Doc reconciliation:** §1 Tag/Caption 100% done; WandB/LoggingCard done; Merging tool half-done; BD-1 not started; Reflow violations likely low-RAM environmental.

**New ideas:** Post-training "Test in ComfyUI" button (deep-link, no copy); KNX-inspired save node for `software` PNG tag (fork LoraManager save logic).

### 2026-05-20 — Reflow Fixes + Log Stream Cutout + ComfyUI Planning

**Completed:**
- **PR #375** — Reflow fixes: TrainingMonitor rAF scroll, SelectContent positioning, raw buttons → shadcn, MAX_LOGS 500.
- **PR #376** — Log stream cutout: `deque` buffer-relative index bug → `total_lines_written` absolute counter, maxlen 2000, 13 regression tests.
- **§11.1** ComfyUI architecture finalised (submodule, B2 workflow templates, extension system).
- UI-3 (AbortError) and UI-4 (PYTHONUNBUFFERED via `-u`) confirmed done.

**Pending:** PR-0 (OptimizerSchema single source), LT-1+UI-1 (WandB) — both since resolved.

### 2026-04-30 — Beta Bug Bash

**Completed (dev branch):**
- Next.js 15 → 16 upgrade, PostCSS CVE patch, provisioning scripts
- CT-5: CheckpointTrainingConfig types include SD35/CHROMA/ANIMA
- MG-1: Removed deceptive alpha input (auto-calculated)
- MG-2: Documented --save_precision vs --saving_precision difference
- MG-3: Subprocess timeouts (resize=30min, merges=1hr)
- MG-4: CUDA availability check before --device cuda
- UI-4: pollLogs fixed-cadence + visibility-aware + visibilitychange
- HF-1: HF upload token from settings; owner/repoType persist localStorage
- LT-2: enable_bucket reads from config (not hardcoded)
- LT-3: network_train_unet_only guarded to False in checkpoint mode

**Since resolved:** LT-1+UI-1 (wandb_key + LoggingCard), PYTHONUNBUFFERED (via `-u` flag).
**Deferred:** MG-5 (SD3 merge), #349 (upload progress — easy, ~30-40 lines), Tag Viewer + Bulk ops.
**CT-2 closed N/A:** Separate pages already.

## 10. Notes (Original)

- Checkpoint training backend appears functional but needs real-world testing with actual full fine-tune runs
- Merging tool is mostly solid - the issues are UX and reliability, not correctness
- The tag system upgrades are the highest-impact changes for Beta since they directly improve the dataset preparation workflow
- All Civitai-inspired features are UI patterns only - we do NOT use their cloud orchestrator, S3 upload, or SignalR approach

---

## 11. Ecosystem Integration

The goal is a healthy, interconnected set of tools running on the same VastAI/RunPod instance — not a monolith, but a set of apps that are aware of each other and hand off naturally. Training a LoRA should flow directly into testing it. Uploading a model should be one click, not a separate workflow.

---

### 11.1 ComfyUI Frontend Integration

**Priority:** Beta+ (after core beta bugs closed)  
**Status:** Architecture finalised 2026-05-20. **Shipping decision: all-in-one.**
**Source:** v0-generated template, repo at `duskfallcrew/KNX-ComfyUI`, used as reference — not dropped in wholesale. Code lives in the main trainer repo.

#### Shipping decision (2026-05-09)

ComfyUI tab ships **bundled in the main app**. No install flag, no optional clone, no separate repo dependency. Reasons:

- Next.js code-splits routes — the ComfyUI bundle costs **zero RAM until someone actually navigates to the tab**
- The only RAM that matters is the ComfyUI Python backend, which the user controls independently
- Simpler onboarding: one install, one URL, one app
- "Throw wide the gates" — don't gate features behind install complexity

**UX for users without ComfyUI:**
- `/comfyui` tab is always visible in the navbar
- If the backend isn't reachable, the page shows a friendly skeleton/disconnected state (not an error)
- Settings page has a "ComfyUI URL" field (default: `http://localhost:8188`) so users who already have ComfyUI running somewhere can point the app at it — no re-install needed
- Connection status badge on the tab so it's obvious at a glance whether it's live

#### ComfyUI backend: submodule (2026-05-20)

ComfyUI the Python backend ships as a **git submodule** in the trainer repo. It runs co-located on `localhost:8188` — always same machine, no SSH, no remote ComfyUI. Multi-GPU / remote-ComfyUI is explicitly future scope.

Provisioning scripts (`vastai_setup.sh`, `provision_runpod.sh`, `install.bat`) do `git submodule update --init --recursive` to pull it down and start it alongside FastAPI and Next.js. The frontend tab is always present; the disconnected skeleton state covers the case where the user hasn't initialised the submodule yet.

#### Workflow state architecture: B2 (2026-05-20)

We wrap ComfyUI's API — we do not re-implement node logic. Source of truth is always ComfyUI.

**Chosen approach (B2 — workflow-aware template mapping):**
- Ship known workflow templates: each template = `workflow.json` + `node-map.json` (node type → UI control binding)
- Templates live in `frontend/comfy/workflows/` — same spirit as `presets/`
- On connect: load the active template's node map; bind UI controls to node types (not node IDs — IDs shift, types don't)
- On generate: inject current UI values into the template JSON → `POST /comfy/prompt`
- On result: poll `/comfy/history` for output images

**Why not full live-graph reading (B1) yet:** B2 is the right starting point. B1 (reading every node dynamically via `/object_info`) is the long-horizon evolution as the node library grows — the architecture doesn't close that door, it just doesn't require it on day one.

**Architecture switcher (ANIMA ↔ SDXL):**
- Switcher in the UI header swaps which template is loaded — same resizable-panel UI, different workflow JSON + node map underneath
- ANIMA template is first (reference: `guy90sVerySimpleAndEasyTo_v10.json`, tested and verified 2026-05-19 — AuraFlow model sampling node, UNET/CLIP/VAE separate loaders, KSampler, Adetailer, Ultimate SD Upscale)
- SDXL template is the second built-in; in progress, not blocking ANIMA shipping

**Extension model:**
- Community contributions come in two forms: **workflow templates** (new architecture support) and **node packages** (new node type → UI control bindings)
- Both drop into `frontend/comfy/workflows/` — no app code changes needed to add a new architecture
- This is the same philosophy as `presets/` and maps to ComfyUI's own custom node ecosystem

**LoRA Manager integration:**
- The LoRA Manager custom node (`Lora Loader (LoraManager)`) ships with guy90s's workflow and provides a browseable popup UI for LoRA selection
- Our UI has a **LoRA Manager button** — clicking it opens ComfyUI's LoRA Manager in a new browser tab (A1111-style "open extra networks" pattern)
- LoRA selection state reads back from live workflow via the proxy — no separate sync needed

**Node presence check:**
- On connect, `GET /comfy/object_info` returns all loaded node types
- Soft-check: if a node type required by the active template is missing, surface a friendly warning ("This workflow requires LoRA Manager — install it via ComfyUI Manager")
- We do NOT auto-install nodes. Users manage their own ComfyUI custom nodes for now.

#### What the template provides

A complete, well-structured ComfyUI client layer:

| Layer | Files | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| API client | `lib/comfy/client.ts` | REST + WebSocket, auto-reconnect, all ComfyUI endpoints |
| Workflow builders | `lib/comfy/workflows/` | txt2img, img2img, upscale — clean function-based API |
| State stores | `lib/stores/` | Zustand: connection, generation params, queue |
| UI components | `components/comfy/` (14 files) | All shadcn/ui — prompt editor, model selector, LoRA stack, sampler settings, image gallery, queue display, dimension picker, seed control, batch controls, denoise slider, upscale settings, workflow tabs, image input, connection status |
| Types | `lib/comfy/types.ts` | Full typing for all ComfyUI API responses |

All UI components use shadcn/ui — zero styling conflicts with the existing project.

#### The one real integration problem

The client defaults to `http://localhost:8188` and opens a WebSocket directly from the browser. On VastAI/RunPod through Cloudflare tunnel, **the browser cannot reach port 8188** — the tunnel only exposes port 3000.

**Fix:** Add a `/comfyui` reverse proxy to `server.js` (same pattern as the existing FastAPI proxy). Change the client's default `baseUrl` to `/comfyui`. One env var (`COMFYUI_PORT`, default `8188`) controls the target. WebSocket upgrades need a second handler in `server.on('upgrade')`.

#### Implementation sequence

**COMFY-1: Proxy layer (prerequisite for everything else)** — ✅ Done 2026-05-23 (commit `dfc8a1e`)
- `frontend/server.js` — `/comfyui/*` HTTP proxy block strips prefix and forwards to ComfyUI
- `frontend/server.js` — `/comfyui/ws` WebSocket upgrade handler (matches the client's relative `baseUrl + '/ws'` pattern)
- Env var: `COMFYUI_PORT=8188` honored in `server.js` (still TODO: add explicit export in `start_services_vastai.sh`, `start_services_runpod.sh`, `restart.sh` for documentation)
- `lib/comfy/client.ts` — change default `baseUrl` from `http://localhost:8188` to `/comfyui` (handled in COMFY-2 when the file lands in the repo)

**COMFY-2: Library layer** — ✅ Done 2026-05-23 (commit `5ebd646`)
- `lib/comfy/types.ts` — full TypeScript types for all ComfyUI API surfaces (workflow, queue, history, system stats, WebSocket message discriminated union)
- `lib/comfy/client.ts` — `comfyClient` singleton: `submitPrompt`, `interrupt`, `getQueue`, `getHistory` (overloaded), `deleteHistory`, `getObjectInfo`, `getSystemStats`, `getImageUrl`, `ping`, `connectWebSocket` with auto-reconnect
- `lib/comfy/workflows/txt2img.ts` — `buildTxt2ImgWorkflow()` targeting SDXL / SD 1.5 (CheckpointLoaderSimple chain; see **ANIMA note** below)
- `lib/comfy/workflows/img2img.ts` — `buildImg2ImgWorkflow()` with LoadImage + VAEEncode
- `lib/comfy/workflows/index.ts` — barrel re-export
- `lib/comfy/useComfyConnection.ts` — `useComfyConnection()` hook: manages WS lifecycle, status, progress, queue; client ID from `sessionStorage` (stable per tab); `submitTxt2Img` convenience wrapper
- `lib/comfy/index.ts` — top-level barrel export

**COMFY-3: UI components** — ✅ Done 2026-05-23 (commit `5ebd646`)
- `components/comfy/ComfyConnectionStatus.tsx` — pill badge (emerald/yellow/zinc/red) for header
- `components/comfy/GenerateUI.tsx` — full two-panel resizable UI (Splitter); left: prompts, checkpoint, dimensions, sampler settings, LoRA stack, denoise/VAE/CLIP skip; right: image gallery + progress
- `app/comfyui/page.tsx` — connection-aware page shell (connecting / disconnected / error / connected states); BorderGlow disconnected card
- `components/blocks/navigation/navbar.tsx` — added "Generate" top-level nav item → `/comfyui`

**COMFY-4: Settings integration** — ✅ Done 2026-05-23 (commit `5ebd646`)
- `lib/node-services/settings-service.ts` — `comfyui_url?: string` field; GET returns `comfyui_url: settings.comfyui_url ?? 'http://localhost:8188'`; POST merges update
- `app/api/settings/user/route.ts` — accepts `comfyui_url` string in POST body
- `app/settings/page.tsx` — ComfyUI GradientCard section with URL Input before API Keys section; note: changes take effect within 5 s (proxy cache)

**ANIMA workflow vs SDXL — node structure differences**

The bundled SDXL workflow (`guy90sVerySimpleAndEasyTo_v10.json`, adapted from Guy90s) uses a `CheckpointLoaderSimple` chain — a single node loads MODEL + CLIP + VAE. ANIMA uses a completely separate loader pattern:

| Aspect | SDXL / SD 1.5 (`buildTxt2ImgWorkflow`) | ANIMA (`buildAnimaWorkflow` — TODO) |
|--------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Model loader | `CheckpointLoaderSimple` (outputs MODEL[0], CLIP[1], VAE[2]) | `UNETLoader` (MODEL only) |
| CLIP loader | Output [1] of checkpoint | `DualCLIPLoader` (loads two CLIP models for AuraFlow — CLIP-L + T5XXL) |
| VAE loader | Output [2] of checkpoint | `VAELoader` (separate VAE file) |
| Sampling | `KSampler` | `KSampler` + `ModelSamplingAuraFlow` (patches the model's sigma schedule for AuraFlow's non-standard distribution) |
| Detailer | Adetailer via Impact Pack | same |
| Upscaler | Ultimate SD Upscale | same |

`buildAnimaWorkflow()` needs to live at `lib/comfy/workflows/anima.ts` and wire:
- Node 1: `UNETLoader` → `model`
- Node 2: `DualCLIPLoader` → `clip` (clip_name1 = CLIP-L file, clip_name2 = T5XXL file, type = "stable_diffusion" or "flux" depending on AuraFlow version)
- Node 3: `VAELoader` → `vae`
- Node 4: `ModelSamplingAuraFlow` (patches Node 1's model output) → patched `model`
- Nodes 5, 6: `CLIPTextEncode` positive/negative (using Node 2's clip)
- Node 7: `EmptyLatentImage`
- Node 8: `KSampler` (uses patched model from Node 4)
- Node 9: `VAEDecode`
- Node 10: `SaveImage`
- LoRA nodes 20+: `LoraLoader` chain injected between UNETLoader and ModelSamplingAuraFlow

The `GenerateUI` architecture switcher (header toggle) will call `buildAnimaWorkflow` vs `buildTxt2ImgWorkflow` depending on user selection — same resizable panel, different builder underneath. This is tracked in the architecture switcher todo below.

**COMFY-6 (long-horizon): Custom node plugin system**
- Custom node packs map to UI component "plugins" — similar to A1111's extension system
- Installing a custom node pack (e.g. ControlNet, Impact Pack) surfaces a friendly UI panel for it rather than raw node inputs
- Foundation already exists: `lib/comfy/types.ts` has full ComfyUI API typing to build node→component mapping on
- Research: Dataset-Tools already has `lib/comfyui-node-registry.ts` and `lib/comfyui-github-search.ts` — may be the starting point
- **Do not design this until COMFY-1 through COMFY-4 are shipped and stable**

**COMFY-5 (dream feature): "Test in ComfyUI" post-training shortcut**
- When a training job completes, show a "Open in ComfyUI" button on `TrainingMonitor`
- Clicking it navigates to `/comfyui` with the trained LoRA pre-loaded into the LoRA stack
- Requires: COMFY-1 through COMFY-4 complete + ComfyUI actually running on the instance

**COMFY-7: Auto-install required custom nodes (revised stance, 2026-05-23)**

The earlier "we do NOT auto-install nodes" position was conservative scope-trimming, not a technical decision. Since we ship a custom UI template that *requires* specific nodes to function (LoRA Manager, rgthree, Impact Pack, Ultimate SD Upscale), missing nodes = silently broken feature from the user's perspective. Auto-installing is a correctness requirement, not a power-user convenience.

**Required nodes for the bundled SDXL / ANIMA workflow templates:**
- `rgthree-comfy` — https://github.com/rgthree/rgthree-comfy (Seed, Fast Groups Bypasser, Image Comparer)
- `ComfyUI-Lora-Manager` — https://github.com/willmiao/ComfyUI-Lora-Manager (LoRA loader + Save Image)
- `ComfyUI-Impact-Pack` — https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Impact-Pack (DetailerForEach, SAMLoader, ImpactSimpleDetectorSEGS, SEGSPreview)
- `ComfyUI-Impact-Subpack` — https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Impact-Subpack (UltralyticsDetectorProvider)
- `ComfyUI_UltimateSDUpscale` — https://github.com/ssitu/ComfyUI_UltimateSDUpscale (UltimateSDUpscale)
- `comfyui_fearnworksnodes` — **KNX SDXL fork only**: `Checkpoint Loader (LoraManager)` node that loads MODEL+CLIP+VAE from a single checkpoint. Required by `sdxl-knx-v1.json`. Not needed for ANIMA template.
- `ComfyUI-Manager` — https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager (optional but useful so users can add extras themselves)

**Provisioning script approach (preferred):** `vastai_setup.sh` / `provision_runpod.sh` / `install.bat` clone each repo into `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/` and `pip install -r requirements.txt` for each. No ComfyUI Manager dependency, no chicken-and-egg problem, deterministic.

**In-app fallback (later):** On `/comfyui` page load, check `/object_info` for missing node types. If any required node is missing, show a dialog with an "Install missing nodes" button that POSTs to a Next.js API route which runs the equivalent `git clone` server-side. Skip if ComfyUI Manager handles it.

**COMFY-8: ComfyUI backend location — DECIDED 2026-05-23: direct clone everywhere**

`.gitmodules` exists but is empty; `ComfyUI/` directory does not exist. Direct-clone approach chosen over git submodule:

- **All provisioning paths clone ComfyUI consistently** — `vastai_setup.sh`, `provision_runpod.sh`, `install.bat`, `install.sh` each `git clone https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI` into the platform-appropriate directory (e.g. `/workspace/ComfyUI` on remote, `./ComfyUI` next to the trainer locally).
- **No submodule overhead** — no `.gitmodules` config, no `git submodule update --init --recursive` step, no submodule pin to bump.
- **Graceful degrade if missing** — if a local user runs the trainer without having gone through the installer (or deletes their `ComfyUI/` dir), the `/comfyui` page shows the disconnected skeleton state already planned. App stays functional; ComfyUI tab is just inert.
- **Same install loop for custom nodes** — the COMFY-7 custom node install routine runs the same way regardless of how ComfyUI got there.

Rejected: git submodule (extra complexity for no real benefit in this use case; we don't need a version pin since ComfyUI's `main` branch is stable enough and breaking changes are rare).

**COMFY-9: `knx-nodes` ComfyUI custom node package**

A small package owned by KNX that ships alongside the bundled workflow templates. Auto-installed by provisioning scripts the same way as third-party nodes. Initial scope is two nodes:

- **`KNXSaveImage`** — saves images with `Software: KNX Ecosystem` PNG metadata so downstream tools (Dataset-Tools, Discord bots, Civitai) tag the source correctly. Written from scratch using ComfyUI core's `SaveImage` pattern (MIT) — no fork. Optionally embeds a structured `knx_metadata` JSON chunk (template name, workflow version, KNX trainer build).
- **`KNXMetadataReader`** — loads an image and extracts PNG text chunks as ComfyUI `STRING` outputs (positive prompt, negative prompt, seed, model, etc.). Lets users feed an existing image's prompt directly into `CLIPTextEncode` without re-tagging via WD14. Intentionally narrow — read chunks, return strings, no format-scoring heuristics. (Lesson from the vendored sdpr in Dataset-Tools-main: numpy scoring stacks become unmaintainable fast.)

Package layout:
```text
knx-nodes/
├── __init__.py          # NODE_CLASS_MAPPINGS + NODE_DISPLAY_NAME_MAPPINGS
├── knx_save_image.py    # KNXSaveImage
├── knx_metadata_reader.py  # KNXMetadataReader
├── requirements.txt
└── README.md
```

Lives in its own GitHub repo (`Ktiseos-Nyx/knx-nodes` or similar) so the provisioning loop clones it the same way it clones rgthree/Impact Pack. Growth path: any custom node KNX needs that doesn't exist upstream goes here.

**Future ideas (not blocking):** dataset folder save node, training reference metadata embedder, ArcEnCiel-aware Civitai uploader node.

#### Notes
- ComfyUI backend is **directly cloned** by all install paths (local + remote), always co-located on `localhost:8188`. See COMFY-8 above for the decision rationale; the "ComfyUI backend: submodule" subsection further up is superseded.
- The template has workflow builders for `inpaint`, `controlnet`, and `adetailer` types referenced in `types.ts` but not yet built in `workflows/`. Those are future scope.
- Check whether `zustand` is already a dep before adding it — the stores use it.
- **Issue #374 (Reflow Violations)** fixed in PR #375 (2026-05-20). TrainingMonitor auto-scroll moved fully into rAF with cleanup; auto-tag page SelectContent → position="item-aligned"; raw buttons → shadcn Button.

### 11.2 Dataset Tools Integration

**Priority:** Beta+ (NOT gated on COMFY-1 — different mechanism; see architecture below)  
**Status:** ⏳ Not started — integration plan drafted (architecture corrected 2026-05-30: in-app merge, NOT a proxied separate process)  
**Source:** `C:\Users\dusk\Development\Dataset-Tools` / [Ktiseos-Nyx/Dataset-Tools](https://github.com/Ktiseos-Nyx/Dataset-Tools) (same org)  

#### What it is

Dataset Tools is a **local-first image and model browser** with deep AI metadata extraction. Key capabilities not currently in the Trainer:

| Capability | Value to the Trainer ecosystem |
|------------|-------------------------------|
| Image metadata viewer | Inspect reference images before training — see what settings produced them (A1111, ComfyUI, NovelAI, Fooocus, InvokeAI, DrawThings, SwarmUI, etc.) |
| Safetensors inspector | View training metadata embedded in a just-trained LoRA — steps, dataset hash, network args — without leaving the UI |
| ComfyUI workflow viewer | Show the full node graph for ComfyUI-generated reference images; pairs with COMFY-5 |
| Thumbnail viewport | Fast thumbnail browsing with server-side `sharp` WebP generation + disk cache (`.thumbcache/`) |
| Custom node classifier | Identifies ComfyUI custom nodes in a workflow — which are built-in vs. which require extensions |

#### Tech stack compatibility

- Next.js 16 + React 19 — **identical to Trainer** ✓
- shadcn/ui + Radix — **identical to Trainer** ✓
- Pure Node.js API routes — no Python required for the web app
- The `dataset_tools/` Python package in the repo is a **separate CLI tool**, not a web dependency

#### Integration architecture

**Corrected approach (Dusk, 2026-05-30): direct in-app integration — NOT a proxied separate process.** ComfyUI uses a proxy because it's a Python app on its own port; Dataset Tools is the **same Next.js 16 + React 19 + shadcn stack as the Trainer**, so it slots straight into the single app as additional routes/components. **No second Next.js process, no `DATASET_TOOLS_PORT`, no `server.js` proxy block, no extra startup/provisioning steps.** One app, one build, one process.

**DT-1: Merge DT into the Trainer app (in-app)**
- Bring DT's pages in under a namespaced route in the Trainer's `frontend/app/` (e.g. `app/dataset-tools/...`) and its components into `frontend/components/`.
- **Namespace DT's API routes** to avoid collisions — both apps have `app/api/*` (DT has `app/api/fs`, `app/api/comfyui-nodes`, etc.; Trainer has `app/api/files`, `app/api/dataset`, etc.). Move DT's under e.g. `app/api/dataset-tools/*`.
- **Reconcile shared pieces:** dedupe `components/ui/*` (both shadcn — keep one set, watch for version drift), merge `next.config.js` (`serverExternalPackages` for `sharp`, etc.) and any provider/layout wrappers.
- **Settings + thumbnail cache:** DT's settings system and `.thumbcache/` are self-contained — keep them namespaced so they don't clash with Trainer settings.
- Net ops change: provisioning just builds the one app; no separate clone/build/start of a second repo, no port wiring. Code can be vendored/subtree'd from the Dataset-Tools repo or copied in — decide at implementation time.

**Framing (Dusk, 2026-05-30): this is a full combination, bidirectional — not a one-way bolt-on.** The two apps are the same stack, so treat it as unifying them and **bringing DT's optimizations forward into the combined app** (and vice versa). Concretely harvest:
- **UI components** — DT's glassmorphism/glow/cursor/card/tabs set + theme system (already flagged as the §14 unjankification goldmine). Porting these *is* a big chunk of §14.
- **Performance work** — any perf optimizations DT already made (thumbnail caching/`sharp` pipeline, metadata parsing, list virtualization, etc.) apply directly to the Trainer's equivalent pain points (e.g. the dataset gallery / file manager reflow issues).
- **Reusable subsystems** — DT's ComfyUI integration (`comfyui-node-registry.ts`, `comfyui-github-search.ts`, `ComfyUIWorkflowViewer.tsx`) may feed the Trainer's ComfyUI tab directly (cross-ref §11.1).
- Decide which is canonical when both apps have a version of the same thing (shadcn components, settings patterns) and keep the better one. The merge is the opportunity to consolidate, not duplicate.

**DT-2: Navbar link**
- Add "Dataset Tools" entry to the trainer navbar under a new "Ecosystem" section (or alongside "Files")
- Links to `/dataset-tools`

**DT-3: Handoff buttons (the good stuff)**
- **"Inspect in Dataset Tools"** on the files page — deep-link to Dataset Tools with the current folder pre-set
- **"Inspect LoRA"** on training completion — opens the trained `.safetensors` directly in Dataset Tools' safetensors panel
- **"View reference metadata"** in the dataset image gallery — opens a selected image in Dataset Tools' metadata panel

With the in-app merge these become **same-app navigation** (Next router/`<Link>` to the namespaced `app/dataset-tools/...` routes) — simpler than the old cross-app deep-link idea. Can still pass the target via URL params (e.g. `?path=`/`?file=`) and even share state directly if wanted, since it's one app now.

**DT-4: Shared folder awareness**
- Dataset Tools has a `settings.currentFolder` that the user sets manually
- Ideally the Trainer can deep-link with `?folder=/path/to/dataset` so Dataset Tools opens to the right place
- Check if Dataset Tools' settings API accepts a folder override via query param, or whether we need to add it

**DT-5: "KNX Ecosystem" source tag (pairs with COMFY-9)**

Today, images generated by the bundled ComfyUI workflows show up as `Automatic1111` in Dataset-Tools' viewer because the LoRA Manager save node writes a `parameters` PNG chunk in A1111 format, and detection at `lib/parseImageMetadata.ts:181` keys off that chunk. Once `KNXSaveImage` (COMFY-9) writes `Software: KNX Ecosystem`, Dataset-Tools needs a matching detection block:

- **Next.js viewer** (`lib/parseImageMetadata.ts`): add `'KNX Ecosystem'` to the `format` union type; add detection block `if (textChunks['Software'] === 'KNX Ecosystem')` before the A1111 check (mirroring the NovelAI pattern at line 172).
- **Python CLI** (vendored sdpr at `dataset_tools/vendored_sdpr/format/`): add a `KNXFormat` class with `tool = "KNX Ecosystem"` and register it in `image_data_reader.py:PARSER_CLASSES_PNG` ahead of A1111.

Tags both ends of the same ecosystem with one consistent name.

#### Notes
- Dataset Tools has its own settings system and thumbnail cache — these are self-contained, no conflict with Trainer settings
- The Python `dataset_tools/` CLI is a separate tool; ignore it for web integration
- Dataset Tools' `app/api/fs/route.ts` restricts file access to a configured base folder — on VastAI the default base should be `/workspace`
- `.thumbcache/` directory generates WebP thumbnails via `sharp` — with the in-app merge it lives within the single Trainer app; just pick a stable location and ensure `sharp` is in the merged `serverExternalPackages`
- **Dataset-Tools already has ComfyUI integration:** `ComfyUIWorkflowViewer.tsx`, `app/api/comfyui-nodes/route.ts`, `lib/comfyui-node-registry.ts`, `lib/comfyui-github-search.ts`. These may be reusable directly in the trainer's ComfyUI tab — check before building from scratch.
- **UI component goldmine:** glassmorphism components (`glass-notification`, `glass-popover`), glowing effects (`glowing-effect`, `glowingbordercard`), `smooth-cursor`, `vercel-card`, `vercel-tabs`, `kokonutui/ai-loading`. All Next.js 16 + shadcn/ui — direct transplant candidates for the UI unjankification work (Section 14).

### 11.3 Ecosystem Architecture Principles

As more tools are integrated, these rules keep things from becoming a mess:

1. **One port, one tunnel.** All ecosystem tools proxy through port 3000 via `server.js`. No second Cloudflare tunnel endpoints. Users access everything from one URL.
2. **One settings page.** External tool URLs/ports live in the existing settings system, not scattered `.env` files.
3. **Handoff buttons, not deep integration.** Tools stay loosely coupled. A "Test in ComfyUI" button is fine; sharing state stores between tools is not.
4. **Each tool is optional.** If ComfyUI isn't running, the ComfyUI page shows a friendly "not connected" state — it does not break anything else.

### 11.5 SDXL Workflow — Eye Detailer Pass (COMFY-14)

**Status:** 🔧 **Workflow BUILT, UI wiring pending (updated 2026-06-09).** Dusk has already built + tested a **4-pass** Adetailer in `sdxl-knx-v13pt5.json` — Face (`bbox/face_yolov8n`), Eyes (`segm/Anzhc Eyes -seg-hd`), Hands (`segm/PitHandDetailer-v1b-seg`), Mouth (`bbox/adetailer2dMouth_v10`). Remaining work is **exposing the full control surface** in the Generate UI — NOT building or hiding a single auto-fix pass. (The single-eye-pass framing below is superseded; kept only for the bbox-vs-segm wiring reference, which is still accurate.)

**Problem:** Eyes are frequently poorly drawn even with the current detailer. **Root cause is NOT GPU or model** — the workflow only has a *face* detailer (`face_yolov8m`). A face detailer crops the whole face and re-renders it as one region, so the eyes get only a tiny fraction of the new resolution. The fix is a dedicated **eye detailer pass** (standard intermediate SDXL setup; Forge's ADetailer did this by just adding a second tab with an eye model).

**Models:** Dusk already has Anzhc's anime detection models; some are **`-seg-` (segmentation)** models. (Alt refs if needed: "Eyeful" / SnowyYukino eye models on Civitai.) Models live in `ComfyUI/models/ultralytics/{bbox,segm}/` — ties to COMFY-12 (these aren't auto-downloaded).

**Key gotcha — bbox vs segm wire differently (this is the part that wasn't obvious):**
- **bbox model** → rectangle → needs SAM → routes through `Simple Detector (SEGS)` (what the existing *face* chain uses).
- **segm `-seg-` model** → outputs the mask shape directly, **no SAM** → routes through **`SEGM Detector (SEGS)`** (`SegmDetectorSEGS`) using the detector's **SEGM_DETECTOR** output. *(The harmless little red X on the face detector's segm port is just that output being unused on a bbox model — normal, not a bug.)*

**Wiring for the (segm) eye pass:**
```
UltralyticsDetectorProvider (Anzhc eye -seg-) ── SEGM_DETECTOR ──▶ SEGM Detector (SEGS) ──▶ DetailerForEach (eyes)
```
- Splice **after** the face DetailerForEach (#74), **before** Save (#65): face first, then eyes on the cleaned face. (Find what currently feeds Save's image input; insert the eye chain between.)
- DetailerForEach eye inputs: same MODEL/CLIP/VAE/positive/negative as the face pass.
- **Settings:** `guide_size` 256–512 (biggest lever — gives tiny eyes real resolution); `denoise` ~0.4 (redraw without changing eye color/shape/style); SEGM threshold ~0.5 (lower if it misses an eye).

**Design intent (corrected 2026-06-09 — kill the simplify-and-hide bias):** the extra detail passes ARE the feature for this audience, not surface to hide. Phase 1 (wire + tune live) is **done** — v13.5 ships 4 tuned passes. Phase 2 is **expose the full control surface** in the Generate UI:
- **Per-pass on/off** for each detail pass (independent bypass — today's single `adetailerEnabled` only covers ONE of four; that's the correctness bug to fix first).
- **Per-pass detector model** picker, **bbox/segm-aware** so a segm model routes to `SEGM Detector (SEGS)` and a bbox model to `Simple Detector (SEGS)` (the wiring reference above stays authoritative).
- **Per-pass settings** users want to reach (guide_size / denoise / detection threshold) — exposed **inline**, NOT behind an "Advanced drawer." A drawer is *more* machinery (build the show/hide abstraction, decide what's "advanced," manage its state) AND it buries the feature. Inline is both less work and the honest default for this audience.
- **Add/remove passes** beyond the built-in set (see build note — the one genuinely open scope question).

**Do NOT** re-frame this as "auto-fix that hides the wiring" or "one body part at a time, future optional." Dusk already built all four; the job is *surfacing* control, not rationing it. (Recurring bias to resist — see CLAUDE.md "Bleeding Edge" + "Empirical Lore." Past sessions kept writing "nobody needs the extra surface" into this doc and leaving Dusk to force-agree. Stop.)

**Status:** ⏳ Not started | **Priority:** Low (pre-public-release gate)

Snyk removed (SaaS-calibrated noise). Path traversal sanitisation is good practice but not imperative — single-user local tool, private tunnel. `files.py` already protected; `config.py` preset paths need `is_relative_to(presets_dir)` guard; service paths need configurable `WORKSPACE_ROOT` validation.

### 12.2 CWE-78 Command Injection (Snyk — mostly false positives)

**Status:** ⏳ Not started | **Priority:** Low

All subprocess calls use `asyncio.create_subprocess_exec` / list-form `subprocess.run` — no shell, not injectable. Snyk flags conservatively. Audit: no `" ".join(args)` → shell; verify `model_service.py` headers never shell-interpreted.

## Section 13 — In-App Documentation Cleanup

### 13.1 Integrate upstream docs + remove hand-holding bias

**Priority:** Low (post-in-house-testing) | **Status:** ⏳ Not started | **Effort:** Medium

**Pull in:** LyCORIS docs (params/network types), sd-scripts docs (flags/optimizers/schedulers). Strip outdated/contradicted content.

**Remove bias:** Hardware requirement nags on pages user already chose; Claude over-explanation/hedging. Changelog page: populate from git history or delete route.

**Blocked by:** Stable alpha + in-house testing complete.

## Section 14 — UI Unjankification: The Gate-Ripping

**Priority:** Beta (parallel to feature work — can start any time)  
**Status:** Planning phase — 2026-05-09  
**Codename:** "Throw wide the gates" (yes, this is a Crystal Exarch reference, we're keeping it)

### 14.1 The Problem

The trainer works. Performance is excellent — lighter than Gradio alone by a wide margin. But visually the UI is "Gradio adjacent": dense, muted, flat, functional-first but aesthetically anonymous. This happened because we stopped worrying about the UI once the trainer itself needed fixing. Now the trainer is mostly working. Time.

The goal is NOT a ground-up redesign. The component architecture is good, shadcn/ui is good, the structure is sound. The goal is: make it **feel like a product someone chose to use**, not a tool someone had to use.

### 14.2 What "Gradio Adjacent" Actually Means (and what to fix)

| Current state | Target state |
|--------------|--------------|
| Muted blue/gray palette with no identity | A visual identity that's distinctly KNX |
| Cards look identical regardless of importance | Visual hierarchy — primary workflow stands out |
| Rainbow icon colors (`text-cyan-400`, `text-pink-400`) with no semantic meaning | Semantic color use — colors mean something |
| Dense form fields stacked with minimal breathing room | Better spacing, section grouping, visual separation |
| No "alive" feeling — dashboard is a static grid | At least one live element (active job, recent dataset) |
| Placeholder text that explains nothing or explains too much | Tight, useful placeholder copy |
| Error states that look the same as empty states | Distinct states: loading / empty / error / disconnected |
| Training form is one very long scroll with no orientation | Clear sections, maybe sticky section nav or progress steps |

### 14.3 Specific Areas

**A. Visual identity / color**
- **Don't build a theme system — port one.** Dataset-Tools (`Ktiseos-Nyx/Dataset-Tools`) already has a complete, polished theme system: `ThemeCustomizer` (floating toolbar), `color-swatch-selector`, `theme-toggle`, `useThemeColor()` hook. Port these directly. See Dataset-Tools issue #196 "UI/UX Theory!" for context.
- The system uses `data-theme-color` attribute on `documentElement` + CSS variables, with localStorage persistence. 7 accent colors (zinc, red, orange, green, blue, violet, pink). Pairs with `next-themes` for dark/light.
- After porting: pick which accent color(s) to default to for KNX's visual identity. The site's meteor hero has character — the inner pages should match it.
- Semantic colors: green = active/running, amber = warning/needs attention, red = error/stopped, blue = info. Don't use them decoratively.

**B. Dashboard (already tracked as UI-2)**
- Workflow grouping (Dataset → Tag → Train → Upload) instead of 9 undifferentiated tiles
- Live "active jobs" widget at top
- All routes actually listed, not just the 9 currently there

**C. Training form**
- The form is extremely long. Users lose orientation.
- Options: sticky sidebar with section links, collapsible card sections, a step-indicator at the top
- Progressive disclosure: hide rarely-used advanced fields behind an "Advanced" expander per card. Most users never touch `lr_power`, `rank_dropout`, `module_dropout` etc.
- Required fields vs optional fields should look different

**D. Empty/loading/error states**
- Every page that fetches data (models list, dataset list, files) needs a proper skeleton loader, empty state with a CTA, and error state that tells you what to do
- Currently most pages go from loading spinner to content with nothing in between
- Empty states should be friendly: "No datasets yet — upload one to get started" with a button, not just blank space

**E. Feedback and toasts**
- Toast messages are functional but terse. Slightly warmer copy ("Training started! You can close this tab — it'll keep running." not just "Training started.")
- Success toasts feel the same as info toasts. Green for success, neutral for info.

**F. The nav**
- Navbar is functional but dense. On wider screens there's room to show more.
- Consider: active route highlighting is too subtle currently
- Ecosystem tools (ComfyUI, Dataset Tools when added) should have a distinct "Ecosystem" group in the nav

**G. File Manager**
- **More contrast** — the file list is low-contrast and hard to scan. Needs clearer row separation, stronger hover/selected states, and a visible dir-vs-file distinction (structural contrast, per the page-by-page approach here).
- **Copy files (feature, do alongside the contrast pass)** — the files API has list/rename/delete/mkdir/read/write/workspace but **no copy**; `rename` only moves. Add a copy capability: a new `/api/files/copy` route reusing the existing files-route path-safety guards (`is_safe_path`/`ALLOWED_DIRS`), plus a UI action. Pairs naturally with the contrast work since both touch FileManager.

### 14.4 What NOT to do

- Don't do a full design system overhaul. Keep shadcn/ui, keep the component structure.
- Don't add animations for their own sake. Motion only where it aids understanding (loading states, transitions, not decorative spinning).
- Don't make it look like every other AI tool (dark blue + purple gradient = "I was made in an AI studio"). Avoid that.
- Don't touch the meteor background bleed on the hero. It's intentional, it has character.
- Don't redesign and then lose all the accessibility work that's already in place.

### 14.5 Approach

This is iterative, not a big-bang redesign. Work page by page, card by card:

1. **Color/identity** — establish the palette first, apply globally. One session.
2. **Dashboard** — already scoped as UI-2. Pair with color work.
3. **Training form** — progressive disclosure + section orientation. Largest single effort.
4. **Empty/loading/error states** — page by page, can be spread across sessions.
5. **Copy pass** — placeholder text, toast messages, descriptions. Fast, high-impact.
6. **Nav polish** — last, once content is stable.

### 14.6 Priority Matrix

| Task | Effort | Impact | Status |
|------|--------|--------|--------|
| Port theme system from Dataset-Tools (customizer + swatches + hook) | Small | High | ⏳ Not started |
| **Theme-matched button glow:** faint `box-shadow` behind buttons driven by theme CSS vars (`--primary` etc.) on the existing shadcn `Button` — ship alongside expanded color themes. Keep subtle, no neon/flashing. No bare HTML / primitives needed (pure CSS via className). | Tiny | Low | ⏳ Not started |

| **Slate purge:** `DatasetUploader.tsx` + `UppyDatasetUploader.tsx` — raw HTML form elements + `bg-slate-800`/`border-slate-600` → shadcn components + CSS vars | Medium | High | ✅ Done 2026-06-16 (4 raw `<input>`→shadcn `<Input>`, `<label>`→`<Label>`, slate divs→`bg-muted`/`border-border`; validation borders kept as semantic yellow/red; tsc clean) |
| **Custom → shadcn audit:** `components/effects/` custom cards/borders/buttons — identify which can be replaced by installed shadcn components, retire the rest. Root cause: went custom early before knowing what shadcn had. | Small | Medium | ⏳ Not started |
| **Hero slate:** `hero-animated.tsx` gradient strings bake in `slate-950` — make theme-aware or replace with CSS var equivalents | Tiny | Low | ⏳ Held for visual call (2026-06-16) — the `slate-950` gradients are ALREADY behind `isDark ? dark : light` ternaries (not a theme bug; deliberate dark base). Swapping to `bg-background`/`bg-muted` would change the designed dark hero. Also two raw `<button>` CTAs here (lines ~150/163) — pairs with the a11y raw-button→shadcn pass. Needs Dusk's eye, not a mechanical swap. |
| **a11y: numeric inputs for Steps & CFG** — on the Generate page (`GenerateUI.tsx`) Steps and CFG are slider-only; add paired numeric `<Input>` (like width/height/seed already have) so values are typeable, precise, and exposed to keyboard/assistive-tech users. | Tiny | Medium | ⏳ Not started |
| **a11y sweep (whole app)** — dedicated pass at some stage (not urgent): keyboard nav, `focus-visible` states, ARIA labels, slider-only controls, color contrast, form-label associations. Audit + fix per page. | Medium | High | ⏳ Not started |

## Section 16 — ArcEnCiel Model Browser

**Priority:** Beta+ / "Nice to Have"
**Status:** Not started
**Permission:** Confirmed with ArcEnCiel team
**Source:** https://github.com/Anzhc/ArcEnCiel-Extension-for-WebUI
**API:** `https://arcenciel.io/api` — public, no authentication required

### What it is

ArcEnCiel (arcenciel.io) is a community model platform hosting LoRAs, checkpoints, VAEs, and embeddings — primarily anime/illustration focused, with strong Illustrious/NoobAI/Pony coverage. Adding it as a second model source gives users an alternative to Civitai, which can be geoblocked or rate-limited.

### API

No API key required. Key endpoints:

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `GET /api/models/search?search=&sort=&page=&limit=&base_model=&type=` | Search models |
| `GET /api/models/{id}` | Model details + versions |
| `GET /api/models/{id}/versions/{version_id}/download` | Download URL for a version |
| `GET /api/models/{id}/gallery` | Preview images |

Response includes model metadata, all versions, activation tags, base model, and direct download URLs. No OAuth, no rate limit enforced in the extension code.

**"Link versions"** = model versions (same LoRA trained on different base models, different training epochs). Not a separate concept — just standard versioning like Civitai.

### Implementation

Same shape as the existing Civitai browser (`/models/browse`). Options:

1. **New route** `/models/arcenciel` — mirrors Civitai browser structure, hits ArcEnCiel API instead. Cleanest separation.
2. **Second tab** on `/models/browse` — toggle between Civitai and ArcEnCiel. More compact.

Backend barely needs touching — the existing download endpoint already handles arbitrary URLs. Only additions needed:
- New Next.js API route: `GET /api/arcenciel/models` (proxy to ArcEnCiel API)
- Frontend page/tab with search, base model filter, model cards, download button

Base model filter values that map to our existing model types: Illustrious, NoobAI, Pony, Flux, SDXL, SD1.5.

### Attribution

## Section 15 — Alternative Training Backends

### 15.1 SimpleTuner

**Priority:** Beta+ / "Big Additions" — full form UI required before shipping  
**Status:** Not started  
**Source:** https://github.com/bghira/SimpleTuner  
**Install:** `pip install simpletuner[cuda]` — standard package, no vendoring needed

#### Why SimpleTuner

SimpleTuner supports 33+ model families that Kohya doesn't cover or covers poorly:

| Notable models | Notes |
|---|---|
| Flux.1 / Flux.2 | Better LoRA support than Kohya's flux path in some community tests |
| Chroma | Full support (Kohya does partial via flux_train.py --model_type chroma) |
| Wan 2.x (video) | Video LoRA — not in Kohya at all |
| LTXVideo / HunyuanVideo | Video fine-tuning |
| HiDream, Lumina2, Sana | Modern image architectures |
| SDXL / SD1.x | Covers the basics too |

It also handles full fine-tuning, LyCORIS (lokr etc.), and quantised training (int8/fp8/nf4) natively.

#### Architecture fit

`BaseTrainer` (`services/trainers/base.py`) already defines the interface — adding SimpleTuner is a new implementation, not a restructure:

```text
services/trainers/
  base.py                 ← existing ABC, no changes needed
  kohya.py                ← existing
  kohya_toml.py           ← existing
  simpletuner.py          ← NEW: BaseTrainer subclass
  simpletuner_config.py   ← NEW: generates config.json + multidatabackend.json
```

Training is invoked via `accelerate launch simpletuner/train.py` (or `simpletuner train`) — same subprocess pattern as Kohya.

#### Config format differences from Kohya

SimpleTuner uses two JSON files instead of one TOML:

1. **`config.json`** — training hyperparams (lr, optimizer, model path, output dir, etc.)
2. **`multidatabackend.json`** — array of dataset backend objects, each with its own resolution, caption strategy, caching dirs, repeat count, and sampling probability

The multidatabackend concept is richer than Kohya's single `dataset_config` — it allows mixing multiple datasets with different settings and weights in one run. For the initial implementation, we can simplify this to a single local backend.

#### Key config fields to expose in the UI

**Core (must have):**
- `model_family` — dropdown of supported architectures (maps to ST's `--model_family`)
- `pretrained_model_name_or_path` — base model path/HF ID
- `model_type` — `lora` or `full`
- `lora_rank` / `lora_alpha`
- `lora_type` — `standard` (PEFT) or `lycoris`
- `learning_rate`, `optimizer`, `lr_scheduler`, `lr_warmup_steps`
- `max_train_steps` or `num_train_epochs`
- `train_batch_size`
- `mixed_precision`, `base_model_precision` (quantisation)
- Dataset dir, caption strategy, resolution

**Dataset backend (simplified for v1):**
- Single local backend only (no AWS/GCS)
- `instance_data_dir`, `instance_prompt`, `caption_strategy`
- `resolution`, `repeats`

**Advanced (progressive disclosure):**
- `gradient_checkpointing`, `gradient_checkpointing_interval`
- `checkpoint_step_interval`, `checkpoints_total_limit`
- Validation: `validation_steps`, `validation_prompt`, `validation_resolution`
- `report_to` (wandb/tensorboard), `tracker_project_name`
- `lora_format` — `diffusers` or `comfyui`
- `lycoris_config` (JSON editor, shown only when lora_type=lycoris)

#### Installation

SimpleTuner is a pip package — install alongside existing deps:
```text
requirements.txt: simpletuner[cuda]
```

It has different torch/diffusers version requirements than Kohya. May need a separate venv or careful dependency alignment — verify before committing to shared venv. If separate venv is needed, use the same subprocess env-injection pattern (`SIMPLETUNER_VENV` path in settings) that could be added alongside `kohya.py`.

#### Frontend scope

Full dedicated training page at `/training/simpletuner` (or a tab switcher on the existing `/training` page). The Kohya form is not reusable — SimpleTuner has fundamentally different fields (model family selector, multidatabackend concept, quantisation options). A new form is the right call.

The `TrainingConfig` Pydantic model is Kohya-specific. Options:
- **Recommended:** A separate `SimpleTunerConfig` Pydantic model + new API route `/api/training/simpletuner/start`
- Alternative: add a `trainer_backend` discriminator to `TrainingConfig` and union the models — more complex, only worth it if we want a single form endpoint

Route in `server.js` `nodeApiPrefixes`: add `/api/training/simpletuner` to the whitelist so it hits Next.js (if we ever migrate) or leave as FastAPI (current pattern).

#### Implementation sequence

1. **ST-1:** `services/trainers/simpletuner.py` + `simpletuner_config.py` — JSON config generation + subprocess invocation. No UI yet. Manual testing via API.
2. **ST-2:** `services/models/simpletuner_config.py` — Pydantic model for SimpleTuner config. New FastAPI route `/api/training/simpletuner/start`.
3. **ST-3:** Frontend form — model family selector, core fields, dataset section, progressive disclosure for advanced.
4. **ST-4:** Preset system — ST presets live in `presets/simpletuner/` to keep them separate from Kohya presets.
5. **ST-5 (future):** Multi-backend dataset config UI — allow defining multiple dataset backends with different weights.

### 15.2 musubi-tuner (Future)

**Priority:** Future / Beta++  
**Status:** Needs scoping — research first  
**Source:** https://github.com/kohya-ss/musubi-tuner (same author as kohya-ss)

Kohya's newer tuning framework. Promising but overlap with existing Kohya backend is significant — needs a proper scope session to determine what it unlocks vs. what we already cover. Do not design until SimpleTuner (§15.1) is shipped and stable.

---

### 15.3 Chroma / Flow Training Improvements (Future)

**Priority:** Future  
**Status:** Not started

Chroma is already partially supported via `flux_train.py --model_type chroma` in the vendored Kohya backend. SimpleTuner (§15.1) adds native Chroma support as a side effect of its broader model family coverage. Evaluate what's still missing after SimpleTuner lands before scoping a dedicated Chroma training path.

## Section 17 — Image → Prompt Helper (WD-Tagger + Florence-2)

**Priority:** Beta / Phase 2  
**Status:** Not started  
**Depends on:** Nothing — WD-tagger and transformers are already in requirements

A standalone utility that takes a single image and returns two things: booru-style tags from WD-tagger and a natural-language caption from Florence-2. The intent is prompt generation — give the tool a reference image, get usable prompt text back. Distinct from the dataset auto-tagger (batch, writes `.txt` sidecar files); this is interactive, single-image, no file writes.

**Natural fit with Dataset-Tools (§11.2):** once Dataset-Tools is embedded, an "Extract Prompt" button on any image in the browser can deep-link here with the image pre-selected.

---

### 17.1 Backend

**New route:** `POST /api/utilities/image-to-prompt`

Accepts a multipart image upload, runs both models, returns:

```json
{
  "tags": ["1girl", "solo", "long_hair", "..."],
  "tag_scores": {"1girl": 0.98, "solo": 0.96, "...": 0.0},
  "caption": "A young woman with long silver hair standing in a forest.",
  "detailed_caption": "..."
}
```

**WD-tagger:** reuse `custom/tag_images_by_wd14_tagger.py` logic but as a Python function call, not a subprocess — or expose a thin single-image endpoint that calls the same ONNX model. Model is already cached by the auto-tag workflow so no extra download on first use.

**Florence-2:** `microsoft/florence-2-base` (~232 MB, fast) or `florence-2-large` (~770 MB, better captions). Use the transformers pipeline with task token `<MORE_DETAILED_CAPTION>`. Lazy-load on first request so startup time isn't affected. Cache the loaded model in a module-level variable (same pattern as the existing BLIP captioner in `caption_service.py`).

Available Florence-2 caption tasks (selectable by user or returned together):
- `<CAPTION>` — one sentence
- `<DETAILED_CAPTION>` — two to three sentences  
- `<MORE_DETAILED_CAPTION>` — paragraph

**New service file:** `services/image_prompt_service.py` — keeps the logic out of the route handler and mirrors the pattern in `captioning_service.py`.

---

### 17.2 Frontend

**Location:** new tab or card in `/utilities`, or its own page `/utilities/image-prompt`.

**UI flow:**
1. Image drop zone (reuse or adapt the one in `DatasetUploader.tsx`)
2. Optional: confidence threshold slider (same as auto-tag page, default 0.35)
3. Optional: Florence-2 model size toggle (base vs large)
4. Submit → spinner → results

**Results panel — two sections side by side:**
- **Tags (WD-tagger):** tag chips (same style as the tag editor), with a "Copy as comma list" button
- **Caption (Florence-2):** text display with length selector (short / detailed / more detailed), copy button

**Combine mode (nice to have):** single "Copy as prompt" button that produces `tags..., caption sentence` — useful for trainers who want structured + natural text together.

---

### 17.3 Models and Deps

| Model | Source | Size | Notes |
|-------|--------|------|-------|
| WD-tagger | Already in project (onnxruntime-gpu) | ~350 MB | No new dep |
| Florence-2 base | `microsoft/florence-2-base` via HF hub | ~232 MB | transformers already a dep |
| Florence-2 large | `microsoft/florence-2-large` via HF hub | ~770 MB | Optional; user chooses |

No new Python packages needed — `transformers`, `Pillow`, `onnxruntime-gpu`, `huggingface-hub` are all already in `requirements_base.txt`.

Florence-2 requires `flash_attn` for best performance but falls back cleanly to standard attention if not installed — don't add it as a hard dep.

---

### 17.4 Implementation Sequence

1. `services/image_prompt_service.py` — WD-tagger single-image wrapper + Florence-2 lazy loader
2. `api/routes/utilities.py` — add `POST /image-to-prompt` endpoint
3. Frontend page/tab — drop zone + results panel
4. Wire confidence threshold and caption length controls
5. (Later) Dataset-Tools deep-link when §11.2 is in progress

---

### 17.5 Open Questions

- **Model size default:** base is fast enough for interactive use; large adds noticeable latency on CPU fallback. Default to base, let user opt into large.
- **WD-tagger model variant:** the project currently uses whatever `wd14_tagger_model_dir` is set to in settings. For the prompt helper, auto-select the best available cached model or download `wd-eva02-large-tagger-v3` if nothing is cached.
- **Florence-2 on VastAI:** model downloads automatically via HF hub — no special VastAI handling needed beyond ensuring `HF_HOME` points somewhere with disk space.

## Section 18 — Frontend Tooling & Follow-up Backlog

### 18.1 Priority Matrix

| Item | Effort | Impact | Status |
|------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Fix Next-16 lint** — ✅ **Done 2026-06-16.** Two fixes: (1) `lint` script `next lint` → `eslint .` (Next 16 removed the subcommand); (2) the `minimatch: expand is not a function` crash was the `brace-expansion` override `>=2.0.3` floating to **v5.0.5**, which moved to ESM named exports and broke `minimatch@3`'s CJS `require()` (eslint's own `@eslint/config-array` + import/jsx-a11y/react plugins all use `minimatch@3`). Capped the override to `>=2.0.3 <3.0.0` (highest CJS, CVE-patched v2 = 2.1.1). Flat config already present (`eslint.config.js` spreads `eslint-config-next@16`'s flat array); removed the dead legacy `.eslintrc.json`. `npm run lint` now runs across the whole project; `tsc --noEmit` still clean. **Follow-up (separate cleanup, NOT the tooling fix):** lint surfaces 71 pre-existing problems (47 errors / 24 warnings) — 21 `react/no-unescaped-entities` (cosmetic), 26 React-Compiler hook rules (`react-hooks/refs`, `preserve-manual-memoization`, `set-state-in-effect`) from eslint-config-next@16's strict defaults, rest warnings. Triage/disable-vs-fix is a content decision, tracked here not done. | Small | High | ✅ Done (tooling) |
| **Frontend unit tests** — no React/Next test runner exists (`tests/` is Python only). Recommend Vitest + React Testing Library (Next 16 / React 19 fit). Would let us unit-test things like the gallery keyboard accessibility instead of relying on manual visual checks. Ties into the existing "smoke tests" intent. | Medium | Medium | ⏳ Not started |
| **LyCORIS re-sync** — vendored LyCORIS is at 67372a `dev16` (synced 2026-05-05); upstream `dev` adds 7 files not yet vendored (assessed 2026-06-22) that split into TWO wiring patterns: **(a) new modules** — `lora2.py` (`LoRA2Module(LoConModule)`), `ortholora.py`, `tsm.py` (`LycorisBaseModule`) → register in `modules/__init__.py` + algo dict, then LoRAType enum + `_map_lora_type_to_network` (`kohya_toml.py:338`) + frontend dropdown, same `algo=X` pattern as ABBA/TLoRA; **(b) init / gradient-hook methods** — `pissa_utils.py` (SVD init), `ralora_utils.py` + `gora_utils.py` (gradient hooks) → NOT new types, exposed as network_args options (need exact LyCORIS arg names + which base algos accept them). Do as a wholesale re-sync per the methodology (preserve our patches). NOT "Small" — the init-method half is fiddly. Nothing breaks without them; TLoRA/ABBA already work (modules vendored). See §11.1. | Medium | Low | ⏳ Not started |
| **`train_llm_adapter` wiring (Anima)** — the arg exists in the vendored backend (sd_scripts `lora_anima.py` + LyCORIS) and is documented, but is NOT exposed in the config flow (`api.ts` / `validation.ts` / `config-service.ts` / `kohya_toml.py` / presets / UI). Currently defaults `False` with no way to enable. Mind the Anima (`networks.lora_anima`) vs LyCORIS network_args path difference. | Small | Low | ⏳ Not started |
| **Preset audit + rename** — review presets for what's actually useful; rename misleading names (e.g. the Illustrious preset labelled "Conservative" that's actually a fast/clean config). Distinct from the format-migration audit (§5.0.96) and optimizer-args contamination (§5.1) — this is a content/naming pass. | Small | Medium | ⏳ Not started |
| **`.jsx` → `.tsx` conversion** (deferred from CR on #386) — convert remaining plain-JSX components to TypeScript per the frontend TS-only policy. `ClickSpark.jsx` is in active use (GenerateUI) so it must be *converted*, not deleted; type the canvas refs, `Spark[]`, and pointer/mouse handlers. (`BorderGlow.jsx` is exempt — slated for deletion via the §14.6 "Custom → shadcn audit".) | Small | Low | ⏳ Not started |
| **Demo/showcase file audit** (deferred from CR on #386) — `*-demo.tsx` and `satori-ui/dotted-modern.tsx` look unused. Either delete them, or fix the nits CR flagged (dotted-modern CTA label/href mismatch, `gooey-input-demo` missing docstring). Decide keep-vs-delete first. | Small | Low | ⏳ Not started |
| **`upload-progress.tsx` dark-mode decision** (deferred from CR on #386) — the redundant `isDark` ternaries were collapsed to a light-only palette (lint fix). Decide whether this aicanvas upload card should actually support dark mode; if yes, supply real dark hex values for the color tokens. Pairs with the §14.6 theme-system work. | Tiny | Low | ⏳ Not started |

### 18.2 Notes

- The hand-built `components/effects/*` (and `components/BorderGlow.jsx`) are confirmed duplicates of installed shadcn/registry components (`shiny-button`, `shine-border`, `hover-border-gradient`, `rainbow-button`, `backlight`, `spotlightcard`, …). Retiring them is already tracked as the "Custom → shadcn audit" row in §14.6.
- Root cause of the duplication (per §14.6): components were built custom early, before knowing what shadcn/the installed registries already provided. Rule going forward: use the installed component; only hand-build when nothing installed/installable fits.

## Section 19 — Repository Root Organization

### 19.1 Problem
~48 tracked files sit at the repo root — mostly install/setup/run/diagnostic scripts plus **six** `requirements*.txt`. Hard to scan; new contributors can't tell which entry point is "the" one.

### 19.2 Proposed grouping (a *plan*, not a blind `git mv`)
- `scripts/install/` — `install.bat`, `install.sh`, `install_frontend.py`, `install_linux.py`, `installer.py`, `installer_windows_local.py`
- `scripts/provision/` — `provision_runpod.sh`, `provision_runpod_dev.sh`, `vastai_setup.sh`, `vastai_setup_dev.sh`
- `scripts/run/` — `start.sh`, `start_services_*.{bat,sh}`, `restart.{bat,sh}`, `fetch-restart.sh`, `run_backend.py`
- `scripts/diagnose/` — `diagnose.{bat,py,sh}`, `clean_slate.py`
- `requirements/` — the six `requirements*.txt`
- **Must stay at root** (auto-discovered by tooling/GitHub): `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes`, `.gitmodules`, `LICENSE`, `pyproject.toml`, `README.md`, and the agent files `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` / `GEMINI.md` / `QWEN.md`. GitHub special files (`CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `SECURITY.md`) may move to `.github/` if wanted.

### 19.3 Critical caveat — NOT a free move
Every relocation breaks references that must be updated **and re-tested on all three platforms (local / VastAI / RunPod)**:
- README install steps (clone → run `install.sh`)
- Cross-script path assumptions (scripts calling siblings / assuming root as cwd)
- VastAI/RunPod provisioning expecting fixed paths
- `pyproject.toml` entry points / `run_backend.py`
- `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` references (e.g. `start_services_local.bat`)
- Installer `project_root` / `install_complete.marker` path math

Do it **incrementally** (one group per PR), re-test each platform, update docs in the same PR.

### 19.4 Quick-win cleanup (independent of the reorg)
- `.snyk` — ✅ **Deleted 2026-06-16** (Snyk removed; policy file was dead).
- `find_fences.py` — ✅ **Deleted 2026-06-16** (one-off code-fence scanner, zero references).

## Section 20 — Backend Delivery & Vendoring Strategy *(decision captured 2026-06-06)*

**Status (REVISED 2026-06-22): vendored + patch-update — CHOSEN. Submodule (former Option A) REVERSED to parked ("too-hard basket, temporarily" — revisit only if update cadence ever justifies the cloud-wiring cost).**

**Decision (2026-06-22): keep the backend VENDORED; switch the update *method* from wholesale flush → targeted patch (cherry-pick the specific upstream files a given feature/fix needs).** Two assumptions the 2026-06-09 submodule lock rested on were falsified this session: (1) "pure consumer / no patch-set" is **FALSE** — we carry live fixes (SDXL-NaN `d39d249`, 5 optimizer crashes `a3b7361`, min_snr/cross-attn `65cb90d`), verified still absent from upstream `sd3-upstream@457914d`, so a fork was needed *either way*; (2) the submodule's real cost — every clone site (`vastai_setup.sh`, `provision_runpod.sh`, both `_dev` variants, installers, docs) must pass `--recurse-submodules` or the backend comes up **EMPTY on cloud** — lands on the most fragile, least-debuggable path. Vendoring keeps the backend as plain in-repo files (cannot come up empty), needs no fork hygiene, keeps `AGENTS.md` "no submodules" honest, and the cherry-pick labor is the assistant's, not Dusk's. Patch-update fits the actual cadence (event-driven — a new model/optimizer/fix — not weekly). **Weakness accepted:** big multi-week catch-up jumps are painful via cherry-pick → reserve a deliberate flush-and-re-apply-patches for those rare cases. (Original Option A reasoning preserved in 20.2/20.3 below as the record of *why* it was once leading.)

- **Correction to an earlier assumption:** ComfyUI does **not** currently prove a submodule-on-cloud pattern here — `.gitmodules` is **empty** and ComfyUI is **direct-cloned** (see COMFY-8 / §11 "ComfyUI backend is directly cloned"). So Option A *pioneers* the submodule-on-cloud pattern in this repo — which is why the 20.4 wiring smoke-check on a real box still matters (the pattern is new *here*), even though the decision itself is settled.
- **Two submodule targets:** (a) the **training backend** → our clean tracking fork of 67372a; (b) **ComfyUI** (currently direct-cloned — intermittent clone failures motivate pinning + one uniform `--recursive` pull for both).
- **Hinge FALSIFIED (2026-06-22):** the "pure consumer / no patch-set" claim was wrong — we DO carry a live patch-set (see 2026-06-22 decision above). A clean tracking fork was never actually on the table, which is a primary reason the submodule lost its edge. Plan: **carry our patches in the vendored tree indefinitely — NO upstream PR** (decided 2026-06-22: 67372a is solo-maintained and a PR would likely sit unmerged forever, so it can't be relied on to shrink the patch-set). On each patch-update, preserve the patch-set (see `upstream_sync_methodology.md`); the set is small (SDXL-NaN + 5 optimizer one-liners, mostly cold files) so the carry cost is low.
- **Robustness is a separate lever (don't conflate):** submodules fix update-cleanliness + pinning, **NOT** clone fragility — a submodule update is still a git fetch. The clone-fragility fix is shallow `--depth 1` + retry, **landed 2026-06-09** in `installer.py` / `installer_windows_local.py` for the direct ComfyUI clone; carry the same `shallow = true` into the submodule. True elimination of clone fragility still needs Docker (Option B, parked).

**Vendored-backend code patches are UN-PAUSED (2026-06-22)** — the submodule swap they were being held for is parked, so patching the vendored tree is again the normal, sanctioned workflow (it IS the chosen delivery method now). Re-apply discipline: before any wholesale flush, preserve our patch-set first (see `upstream_sync_methodology.md`).

### 20.1 The reframe — backend currency is the steady state, not an edge case
Kill the "updating the ML backend is a rare edge case" bias. 67372a ships ~weekly (1,226 commits; our vendored snapshot is ~a month stale as of 2026-06-06). ML moves constantly, so the design criterion is **"updating to latest is trivial, frequent, and low-risk"** — NOT "minimize how often we touch it." Generalizes the project anti-bias rule from training params to process/architecture (cross-ref CLAUDE.md "Bleeding Edge" + "Empirical Lore — Interrogate It").

### 20.2 What's wrong with each delivery mechanism
- **Vendoring (current):** hand-copy slog, no version marker, perpetual drift — "weird/messy." This is the pain we're escaping.
- **Plain `git clone`:** stupidly fragile on cloud (network blips, the documented install cascade).
- **pip-install-from-git — REJECTED:** it's a git fetch at deploy time, so it's the **same fragility class as clone** (Dusk's call, correct). It would only clean up *updates*, not *robustness* — not worth pretending otherwise.

### 20.3 Options
**(A) Submodule → OUR fork of 67372a — *leaning, for now*.**
- Update = bump a pinned SHA (purpose-built for constant change).
- **Licensing alignment (GPL-3.0):** 67372a is GPL-3.0. A submodule *references* their code (clean attribution, no relicensing/propagation question); vendoring *copies* GPL source into our tree — murkier. Submodule is the cleaner GPL posture. (Third reason it wins, alongside update-cleanliness and matching upstream's own pattern.)
- **Machinery is partly present, but the pattern is UNPROVEN here:** `.gitmodules` exists (though **empty**), and `--recursive` covers nesting (67372a itself submodules `sd_scripts @ 457914d`). **Correction (2026-06-09):** ComfyUI is **direct-cloned, not a submodule** — the earlier "ComfyUI backend: submodule (2026-05-20)" note was *superseded* by COMFY-8. So Option A **pioneers** the submodule-on-cloud pattern in this repo rather than widening a proven one — which is why the 20.4 wiring smoke-check on a real box is worth doing (the pattern is new *here*): a wiring confirmation, not a reason to doubt the decision.
- **Honest boundary:** fixes *update cleanliness*, NOT *clone robustness* — still git-clone-based. Clone fragility stays parked until (B).
- **Precedent ≠ proof:** the ComfyUI submodule path is itself still pending live cloud verification.
- **HINGE QUESTION — RESOLVED (2026-06-09):** we were never carrying a private patch-set; the pain was *chasing upstream by hand*, not maintaining divergent patches. So we're effectively a **pure consumer** → the submodule points at our **clean tracking fork** of 67372a (a stable pin we control + the base to PR fixes back upstream), staying close to upstream and low-maintenance. Not a fork to hold patches.

**(B) Pre-baked Docker image — *long-term, deliberately parked*.**
- The only option that truly fixes clone fragility (backend pre-installed → no runtime clone/install cascade).
- Parked by Dusk's explicit call (2026-06-06): **not because it's wrong** — it's the gold standard — but a hands-on **knowledge gap** (Docker + service offloading + security layers he hasn't worked with directly). Revisit when he's ready. **Do not push it.**

**(C) Status-quo vendoring — *fallback*.** Just clones, freely patchable, but the staleness/drift is exactly the pain. Keep only if (A) proves too fragile in the de-risk test.

### 20.4 Wiring smoke-check before flipping main (NOT a referendum on the decision)
The decision is made — submodule beats vendoring, full stop (it ends the hand-chasing; pinning + shallow make it *less* fragile, not more). This is **not a test of whether the approach works** — it's a one-box confirmation that the **provisioning scripts wire `--recurse-submodules` + `shallow = true` correctly** for both targets (backend fork + ComfyUI) on a real cloud host. We're catching a wiring typo, not re-litigating the approach. The old submodule burn was cloud-execution competence, not the mechanism. Verify GUI-first: read the install log via file-browser/Jupyter (`/workspace/Ktiseos-Nyx-Trainer/logs/`), open the app, run a tiny job — no SSH needed for the happy path.

### 20.5 Why staying current matters — what 67372a shipped since our ~2026-05-05 snapshot
New optimizers (SODA/MODA/AMUSE, AdamWScheduleFreePlus, nor_muon_schedulefree, OCGOptV2, fftdescent); adaptive non-uniform timestep sampling (arXiv:2411.09998); Weight Noising; Latent Wavelet Diffusion masking; `min_snr_gamma_soft` + Min-SNR-gamma for flow-matching models; ICC-aware color (`to_srgb()` replacing `.convert('RGB')`); LyCORIS T-LoRA via LoCon/ortholora; Anima leco + addift; flash-attn guard for < CUDA sm_80; REX scheduler fixes. We're missing all of it.

### 20.6 Related — torchao is now installed upstream (cross-ref §4.4)
67372a migrated installs pip→**uv** and added torchao via `--index-strategy unsafe-best-match` (2026-05-30) — upstream resolves torchao against the *installed* torch instead of a hard pin, which solves the version-coupling risk that argued against adding it standalone. **RESOLVED 2026-06-22:** with the submodule parked and patch-update chosen, torchao was added standalone as `torchao==0.7.0` in `requirements_base.txt` (see §4.4 Status) — cross-platform + torch-2.4.1-safe via the pure-Python `torchao.utils` path. The old "decide as part of the sync" framing is moot.

### 20.7 uv for provisioning installs *(backlog, captured 2026-06-22)*
**Goal:** use **uv** for **remote/cloud** dependency installs (provisioning), keep **pip the default on local with uv as an opt-in choice** — never force uv on local devs.

- **Why remote:** uv installs are faster + parallel + cached → less GPU-rental time burned on the provisioning cascade (literal $ saved while the rented GPU idles during setup). Also matches 67372a's own pip→uv migration, and uv's resolver (`--index-strategy unsafe-best-match`) handles torch-coupled deps cleanly (the exact trick that resolves torchao against the *installed* torch).
- **Why local = choice:** some local devs only have pip; mandating uv adds friction for no benefit. Document both paths; default pip.
- **Zero conflict with current state:** uv reads our existing `requirements_*.txt` (`uv pip install -r ...`), so the `torchao==0.7.0` pin and all other pins work unchanged. Nothing to re-spec.
- **Scope / risk:** touches the **fragile provisioning path** (`vastai_setup.sh`, `provision_runpod.sh` + `_dev`, installers) — so it gets its **own** scoping + a real container test, same discipline the parked submodule (§20.1–20.4) demanded. Don't bolt it onto unrelated changes. uv quirks to settle: venv vs `--system`, the cu121 torch extra-index under uv, ensuring the installer's torch-reinstall fallback still works.
- **Status:** ⏳ **Backlog — not started.** Separate workstream from the torchao patch (which shipped on plain pip).

## Section 20 — AMD GPU Support (ZLUDA) — Research *(captured 2026-05-30)*

### 20.1 Interest
App currently assumes NVIDIA/CUDA everywhere (local + VastAI + RunPod). Dusk wants to scope eventual **AMD GPU support**. Reference: `patientx/ComfyUI-Zluda` — a Windows-only ComfyUI distribution that uses **ZLUDA** to run CUDA workloads on AMD GPUs, with install paths for RX 400/500 through RDNA4 9000-series.

### 20.2 Scope notes (research-only, not committed)
- **Split reality (per Dusk 2026-05-30):** the two halves of the app have very different AMD outlooks:
  - **Training (sd-scripts):** *should* work on ZLUDA hardware — this is the realistic AMD path. (Unconfirmed end-to-end, but the expected-viable side.)
  - **ComfyUI / generation side:** currently effectively **NVIDIA-only** — this is the blocker, not training.
- ZLUDA is Windows-only and a CUDA-translation layer — implications for the Linux VastAI/RunPod targets are different (ROCm is the Linux AMD path). Needs separate investigation per platform.
- Unknowns to research before any commitment (training side first, since it's the viable one): does the vendored sd-scripts stack actually run under ZLUDA end-to-end? bitsandbytes / xformers / custom optimizers (CAME, etc.) AMD compatibility? onnxruntime tagging path on AMD?
- Not a beta blocker. Parked as a forward-looking platform expansion.
