## üöÄ Quick Start

### What You Need
- **Computer**: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Python**: Version 3.10 ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT: Python 3.12+ will break dependencies!**
- **GPU**: NVIDIA GPU with 8GB+ VRAM recommended (can work with less)
- **Git**: For downloading this project (explained below)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Python Version Compatibility

**üîç Check Your Python Version First:**
```bash
python --version
# Should show Python 3.10.x - if it shows 3.12+, you'll need to fix this
```

**‚úÖ Compatible Environments:**
- **Local**: Python 3.10.x installations
- **Anaconda/Miniconda**: Create environment with Python 3.10
- **Docker/Containers**: PyTorch or CUDA containers with Python 3.10
- **VastAI**: PyTorch/CUDA templates (avoid base Ubuntu images)

**‚ùå Known Issues:**
- **Python 3.12+**: Breaks TensorFlow dependencies (common in newer systems)
- **Base Ubuntu 22.04+**: Often ships with Python 3.12
- **Latest Anaconda**: May default to Python 3.12

**üîß How to Fix Python Version Issues:**

**Local Users (Windows/Mac/Linux):**
```bash
# Create Python 3.10 environment with conda/miniconda
conda create -n lora-training python=3.10
conda activate lora-training
```

**Docker Users:**
Use PyTorch or CUDA base images instead of plain Ubuntu:
- `pytorch/pytorch:2.0.1-cuda11.7-cudnn8-devel`
- `nvidia/cuda:11.8-cudnn8-devel-ubuntu20.04`

**VastAI Users:** 
Select templates with "PyTorch" or "CUDA" rather than "Ubuntu" base images.

### Installation

1.  **Get Git** (if you don't have it)

    Git is a tool for downloading code projects. Don't worry - you just need to install it once and you're done!
    
    **Check if you already have Git:** Open your terminal/command prompt and type `git --version`. If you see a version number, you're good to go!
    
    **If you need to install Git:**
    -   **Windows**: Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and run the installer
    -   **Mac**: Open Terminal and type `xcode-select --install` 
    -   **Linux**: Type `sudo apt-get install git` (Ubuntu/Debian) or use your system's package manager

2.  **Download This Project**

    Open your terminal/command prompt and navigate to where you want the project folder. Then run:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Ktiseos-Nyx/Lora_Easy_Training_Jupyter.git
    cd Lora_Easy_Training_Jupyter
    ```

3.  **Run Setup**

    This automatically installs everything you need:
    
    **Mac/Linux:**
    ```bash
    chmod +x ./jupyter.sh
    ./jupyter.sh
    ```
    
    **Windows (or if the above doesn't work):**
    ```bash
    python ./installer.py
    ```
    
    Just wait for it to finish - it downloads the training tools and sets everything up.

### Start Training

**If using VastAI or similar:** Jupyter is probably already running - just open the notebooks in your browser.

**If on your own computer:** Start Jupyter like this:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

**Then open these notebooks:**
1. `Dataset_Maker_Widget.ipynb` - Prepare your images and captions
2. `Lora_Trainer_Widget.ipynb` - Set up and run training  
3. `LoRA_Calculator_Widget.ipynb` - Calculate training steps (optional)

## üìñ How to Use

### Step 1: Prepare Your Images

Open `Dataset_Maker_Widget.ipynb` and run the first cell:

```python
# This starts the dataset preparation tool
from widgets.dataset_widget import DatasetWidget
dataset_widget = DatasetWidget()
dataset_widget.display()
```

Upload your images (ZIP files work great!) and the system will auto-tag them for you.

### How to Get Model/VAE Links

To use custom models or VAEs, you need to provide a direct download link. Here‚Äôs how to find them on popular platforms:

#### From Civitai

**Method 1: Using the Model Version ID**

This is the easiest method if a model has multiple versions.

1.  Navigate to the model or VAE page.
2.  Look at the URL in your browser's address bar. If it includes `?modelVersionId=XXXXXX`, you can copy the entire URL and paste it directly into the widget.
3.  If you don't see this ID, try switching to a different version of the model and then back to your desired version. The ID should then appear in the URL.

![How to get a link from Civitai using the version ID](./assets/model_url_civitai_1.png)

**Method 2: Copying the Download Link**

Use this method if the model has only one version or if a version has multiple files.

1.  On the model or VAE page, scroll down to the "Files" section.
2.  Right-click the **Download** button for the file you want.
3.  Select "Copy Link Address" (or similar text) from the context menu.

![How to get a link from Civitai by copying the download address](./assets/model_url_civitai_2.png)

#### From Hugging Face

**Method 1: Using the Repository URL**

1.  Go to the main page of the model or VAE repository you want to use.
2.  Copy the URL directly from your browser's address bar.

![How to get a link from Hugging Face using the repository URL](./assets/model_url_hf_1.png)

**Method 2: Copying the Direct File Link**

1.  Navigate to the "Files and versions" tab of the repository.
2.  Find the specific file you want to download.
3.  Click the **"..."** menu to the right of the file size, then right-click the "Download" link and copy the link address.

### Step 2: Train Your LoRA

Open `Lora_Trainer_Widget.ipynb` and run the cells to start training:

```python
# First, set up your environment
from widgets.setup_widget import SetupWidget
setup_widget = SetupWidget()
setup_widget.display()

# Then configure training
from widgets.training_widget import TrainingWidget  
training_widget = TrainingWidget()
training_widget.display()
```

**Good Starting Settings:**
- Learning Rate: UNet `5e-4`, Text Encoder `1e-4`
- LoRA: `8 dim / 4 alpha` (works for most characters)
- Target: 250-1000 training steps (the calculator helps you figure this out)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Known Issues & Compatibility

‚ö†Ô∏è **Flux/SD3.5 Training (EXPERIMENTAL)**
- The `Flux_SD3_Training/` folder contains **work-in-progress** Flux and SD3.5 LoRA training
- May not function correctly - still under active development
- Use at your own risk for testing purposes only

‚ö†Ô∏è **Triton/ONNX Compatibility Warnings**
- **Docker/VastAI users**: Triton compiler may fail with AdamW8bit optimizer
- **Symptoms**: "TRITON NOT FOUND" or "triton not compatible" errors
- **Solution**: System will auto-fallback to AdamW (uses more VRAM but stable)
- **ONNX Runtime**: Dependency conflicts possible between `onnxruntime-gpu` and `open-clip-torch`

‚ö†Ô∏è **Advanced LoRA Methods (EXPERIMENTAL)**
- **DoRA, GLoRA, BOFT (Butterfly)**: May not function correctly as of yet
- **Status**: Currently under testing and validation
- **Recommendation**: Use standard LoRA or LoCon for stable results
- **More testing**: Additional compatibility testing is ongoing

‚ö†Ô∏è **VastAI/Cloud Instance Compatibility Issues**
- **Reality**: VastAI instances vary wildly - some work perfectly, others are broken out of the box
- **Common Issues**: Triton, ONNX, bitsandbytes, xFormers, and WandB may fail depending on the specific instance
- **Symptoms**: 
  - Dependency conflicts, import errors, CUDA detection failures
  - WandB 403 errors (Cloudflare/network routing issues)
  - "Library not found" or version compatibility problems
- **Before reporting bugs**: Test basic functionality on your specific instance first
- **Solutions**:
  - **First step**: Try the environment setup - it may resolve dependency issues
  - **WandB fails**: Clear API key to use local TensorBoard logging instead
  - **Dependencies broken**: Try `/venv/main/bin/pip install --force-reinstall [package]`
  - **Everything fails**: Kill the instance and try a different VastAI server
- **Bottom line**: If your instance can't do basic operations (import libraries, zip files), it's fundamentally broken - get a new one
