# LoRA Easy Training - Jupyter Widget Edition üöÄ

**Train LoRAs with guided notebooks instead of confusing command lines**

This is a user-friendly LoRA training system based on proven methods from popular Colab notebooks. Instead of typing scary commands, you get helpful widgets that walk you through each step. Works on your own computer or rented GPU servers.

## About

- Widget-based interface designed for both beginners and advanced users
- Please note this is STILL a work in progress.
- Testing was only done on a singular RTX 4090 on a Vast AI Docker Container with pre installed SD WEB UI FORGE.
- Results MAY vary, please feel free to report issues as you see fit.
- The system has been recently streamlined with improved widget organization and calculator accuracy.

- Memory-efficient optimizers (CAME, Prodigy Plus)
- Special LoRA types (DoRA, LoKr, LoHa, IA¬≥, BOFT, GLoRA)
- Memory-saving options for smaller GPUs

### üõ†Ô∏è **Easy Setup**
- Two simple notebooks: one for datasets, one for training
- Works with VastAI and other GPU rental services
- Checks your system automatically

### üìä **Dataset Tools**
- Auto-tag your images (WD14 for anime, BLIP for photos)
- Add/remove tags easily
- Upload ZIP files or folders

## üöÄ Quick Start

### What You Need
- **Computer**: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Python**: Version 3.10 or newer 
- **GPU**: NVIDIA GPU with 8GB+ VRAM recommended (can work with less)
- **Git**: For downloading this project (explained below)

### Installation

1.  **Get Git** (if you don't have it)

    Git is a tool for downloading code projects. Don't worry - you just need to install it once and you're done!
    
    **Check if you already have Git:** Open your terminal/command prompt and type `git --version`. If you see a version number, you're good to go!
    
    **If you need to install Git:**
    -   **Windows**: Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and run the installer
    -   **Mac**: Open Terminal and type `xcode-select --install` 
    -   **Linux**: Type `sudo apt-get install git` (Ubuntu/Debian) or use your system's package manager

2.  **Download This Project**

    Open your terminal/command prompt and navigate to where you want the project folder. Then run:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Ktiseos-Nyx/Lora_Easy_Training_Jupyter.git
    cd Lora_Easy_Training_Jupyter
    ```

3.  **Run Setup**

    This automatically installs everything you need:
    
    **Mac/Linux:**
    ```bash
    chmod +x ./jupyter.sh
    ./jupyter.sh
    ```
    
    **Windows (or if the above doesn't work):**
    ```bash
    python ./installer.py
    ```
    
    Just wait for it to finish - it downloads the training tools and sets everything up.

### Start Training

**If using VastAI or similar:** Jupyter is probably already running - just open the notebooks in your browser.

**If on your own computer:** Start Jupyter like this:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

**Then open these notebooks:**
1. `Dataset_Maker_Widget.ipynb` - Prepare your images and captions
2. `Lora_Trainer_Widget.ipynb` - Set up and run training  
3. `LoRA_Calculator_Widget.ipynb` - Calculate training steps (optional)

## üìñ How to Use

### Step 1: Prepare Your Images

Open `Dataset_Maker_Widget.ipynb` and run the first cell:

```python
# This starts the dataset preparation tool
from widgets.dataset_widget import DatasetWidget
dataset_widget = DatasetWidget()
dataset_widget.display()
```

Upload your images (ZIP files work great!) and the system will auto-tag them for you.

### How to Get Model/VAE Links

To use custom models or VAEs, you need to provide a direct download link. Here‚Äôs how to find them on popular platforms:

#### From Civitai

**Method 1: Using the Model Version ID**

This is the easiest method if a model has multiple versions.

1.  Navigate to the model or VAE page.
2.  Look at the URL in your browser's address bar. If it includes `?modelVersionId=XXXXXX`, you can copy the entire URL and paste it directly into the widget.
3.  If you don't see this ID, try switching to a different version of the model and then back to your desired version. The ID should then appear in the URL.

![How to get a link from Civitai using the version ID](./assets/model_url_civitai_1.png)

**Method 2: Copying the Download Link**

Use this method if the model has only one version or if a version has multiple files.

1.  On the model or VAE page, scroll down to the "Files" section.
2.  Right-click the **Download** button for the file you want.
3.  Select "Copy Link Address" (or similar text) from the context menu.

#### From Hugging Face

**Method 1: Using the Repository URL**

1.  Go to the main page of the model or VAE repository you want to use.
2.  Copy the URL directly from your browser's address bar.

![How to get a link from Hugging Face using the repository URL](./assets/model_url_hf_1.png)

**Method 2: Copying the Direct File Link**

1.  Navigate to the "Files and versions" tab of the repository.
2.  Find the specific file you want to download.
3.  Click the **"..."** menu to the right of the file size, then right-click the "Download" link and copy the link address.

### Step 2: Train Your LoRA

Open `Lora_Trainer_Widget.ipynb` and run the cells to start training:

```python
# First, set up your environment
from widgets.setup_widget import SetupWidget
setup_widget = SetupWidget()
setup_widget.display()

# Then configure training
from widgets.training_widget import TrainingWidget  
training_widget = TrainingWidget()
training_widget.display()
```

**Good Starting Settings:**
- Learning Rate: UNet `5e-4`, Text Encoder `1e-4`
- LoRA: `8 dim / 4 alpha` (works for most characters)
- Target: 250-1000 training steps (the calculator helps you figure this out)

## 3. Extras

```bash
python3 personal_lora_calculator.py
```

This tool helps you:
- Calculate optimal repeats and epochs for your dataset size
- Get personalized learning rate recommendations
- Estimate total training steps
- Build confidence for any dataset size (no more guesswork!) üéØ
